17597498,"Improvement in sensory impairment and social interaction in young children with autism following treatment with an original Qigong massage methodology. In clinical research, sensory impairment is considered one of the core deficits in autism and is associated with impaired socialization, behavioral disturbances and bowel and sleep problems. The effectiveness of the Cignolini methodology, an original Qigong massage methodology, in treating sensory impairment in young children with autism was evaluated in a small, controlled study. Thirteen children with autism between the ages of three and six received daily treatment according to the methodology for 5 months. Compared with untreated children, treated children experienced significant improvement of their sensory impairment ( p < 0.01 ), and demonstrated increased social skills ( p < 0.04 ) and basic living skills ( p < 0.02 ) on standardized measures. In addition, all of the children with bowel and sleep abnormalities demonstrated improvement after treatment.","['young children with autism', 'sensory impairment in young children', 'Thirteen children with autism between the ages of three and six', 'children with bowel and sleep abnormalities']",Thirteen children with autism between the ages of three and six,C,"['original Qigong massage methodology .', 'Cignolini methodology , an original Qigong massage methodology']","daily treatment according to the Cignolini methodology, an original Qigong massage methodology, for 5 months",P,"['sensory impairment', 'social skills', 'basic living skills']","significant improvement of their sensory impairment (p < 0.01), increased social skills (p < 0.04), basic living skills (p < 0.02), and improvement in bowel and sleep abnormalities",C,,1.1167470964180197,1.0,0.4230769230769231,0.5945945945945945,50.0,0.5113984034207734,0.4666666666666667,0.6363636363636364,0.5384615384615385,100.0,0.1190712704913024,0.25,1.0,0.4,100.0
23592849,"The role of treatment fidelity on outcomes during a randomized field trial of an autism intervention. This randomized field trial comparing Strategies for Teaching based on Autism Research and Structured Teaching enrolled educators in 33 kindergarten-through-second-grade autism support classrooms and 119 students, aged 5-8 years in the School District of Philadelphia. Students were assessed at the beginning and end of the academic year using the Differential Ability Scales. Program fidelity was measured through video coding and use of a checklist. Outcomes were assessed using linear regression with random effects for classroom and student. Average fidelity was 57 % in Strategies for Teaching based on Autism Research classrooms and 48 % in Structured Teaching classrooms. There was a 9.2-point ( standard deviation = 9.6 ) increase in Differential Ability Scales score over the 8-month study period, but no main effect of program. There was a significant interaction between fidelity and group. In classrooms with either low or high program fidelity, students in Strategies for Teaching based on Autism Research experienced a greater gain in Differential Ability Scales score than students in Structured Teaching ( 11.2 vs. 5.5 points and 11.3 vs. 8.9 points, respectively ). In classrooms with moderate fidelity, students in Structured Teaching experienced a greater gain than students in Strategies for Teaching based on Autism Research ( 10.1 vs. 4.4 points ). The results suggest significant variability in implementation of evidence-based practices, even with supports, and also suggest the need to address challenging issues related to implementation measurement in community settings.","['autism', '33 kindergarten-through-second-grade autism support classrooms and 119 students , aged 5-8 years in the School District of Philadelphia .

PURPOSE To investigate the efficacy and safety of corneal collagen cross-linking ( CXL ) with photoactivated riboflavin ( photoactivated chromophore for infectious keratitis [ PACK ] -CXL ) in the management of infectious keratitis with corneal melting. DESIGN Prospective clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS Forty eyes from 40 patients with advanced infectious keratitis and coexisting corneal melting. METHODS Twenty-one patients ( 21 eyes ) underwent PACK-CXL treatment in addition to antimicrobial therapy. The control group consisted of 19 patients ( 19 eyes ) who received only antimicrobial therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The slit-lamp characteristics of the corneal ulceration, corrected distance visual acuity, duration until healing, and complications were documented in each group. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical analysis. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS The average time until healing was 39.76 Â± 18.22 days in the PACK-CXL group and 46.05 Â± 27.44 days in the control group ( P = 0.68 ). After treatment and healing, corrected distance visual acuity was 1.64 Â± 0.62 in the PACK-CXL group and 1.67 Â± 0.48 in the control group ( P = 0.68 ). The corneal ulceration 's width and length was significantly bigger in the PACK-CXL group ( P = 0.004 and P = 0.007 ). Three patients in the control group demonstrated corneal perforation ; infection recurred in 1 of them. No serious complications occurred in the PACK-CXL group. CONCLUSIONS Corneal CXL with photoactivated riboflavin did not shorten the time to corneal healing ; however, the complication rate was 21 % in the control group, whereas there was no incidence of corneal perforation or recurrence of the infection in the PACK-CXL group. These results indicate that PACK-CXL may be an effective adjuvant therapy in the management of severe infectious keratitis associated with corneal melting.","['advanced infectious keratitis with corneal melting .', 'Forty eyes from 40 patients with advanced infectious keratitis and coexisting corneal melting .', 'Twenty-one patients ( 21 eyes ) underwent PACK-CXL treatment in addition to antimicrobial therapy .

12358871,"Multifaceted support to improve clinical decision making in diabetes care: a randomized controlled trial in general practice. AIMS To evaluate the effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention to improve the clinical decision making of general practitioners ( GPs ) for patients with diabetes. To identify practice characteristics which predict success. METHODS Cluster randomized controlled trial with 124 practices and 185 GPs in The Netherlands. The intervention group received feedback reports and support from a facilitator ; the control group received no special attention. Outcome measures were the compliance rates with evidence-based recommendations pertaining to discussion of body weight control, discussion of problems with medication, blood pressure measurement, foot examination, eye examination, initiating anti-diabetic medication or increasing the dosage in cases of uncontrolled blood glucose, and scheduling a follow-up appointment. RESULTS The GPs reported on their clinical decision making in 1410 consultations with Type 2 diabetic patients at baseline and 1449 consultations after the intervention period. The intervention resulted in statistically significant improvement for two of the seven outcome measures: foot examination ( odds ratio 1.68 ; 95 % confidence interval 1.19-2.39 ) and eye examination ( 1.52 ; 1.07-2.16 ). Discussion of problems with medication showed a near significant trend towards increased benefit for the intervention group ( 1.52 ; 0.99-2.32 ). Practice characteristics were not found to be related to the success of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS Feedback reports with support from facilitators appear to increase rates of foot examination and eye examination in general practice.

23975885,"Increase in 2-long terminal repeat circles and decrease in D-dimer after raltegravir intensification in patients with treated HIV infection: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial. BACKGROUND The degree to which human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) continues to replicate during antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) is controversial. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess whether raltegravir intensification reduces low-level viral replication, as defined by an increase in the level of 2-long terminal repeat ( 2-LTR ) circles. METHODS Thirty-one subjects with an ART-suppressed plasma HIV RNA level of < 40 copies/mL and a CD4 ( + ) T-cell count of â‰¥350 cells/mm ( 3 ) for â‰¥1 year were randomly assigned to receive raltegravir 400 mg twice daily or placebo for 24 weeks. 2-LTR circles were analyzed by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction at weeks 0, 1, 2, and 8. RESULTS The median duration of ART suppression was 3.8 years. The raltegravir group had a significant increase in the level of 2-LTR circles, compared to the placebo group. The week 1 to 0 ratio was 8.8-fold higher ( P =.0025 ) and the week 2 to 0 ratio was 5.7-fold higher ( P =.023 ) in the raltegravir vs. placebo group. Intensification also led to a statistically significant decrease in the D-dimer level, compared to placebo ( P =.045 ). CONCLUSIONS Raltegravir intensification resulted in a rapid increase in the level of 2-LTR circles in a proportion of subjects, indicating that low-level viral replication persists in some individuals even after long-term ART. Intensification also reduced the D-dimer level, a coagulation biomarker that is predictive of morbidity and mortality among patients receiving treatment for HIV infection.","['patients with treated HIV infection :', 'Thirty-one subjects with an ART-suppressed plasma HIV RNA level of < 40 copies/mL and a CD4 ( + ) T-cell count of Ã¢â€°Â¥350 cells/mm ( 3 ) for Ã¢â€°Â¥1 year', 'among patients receiving treatment for HIV infection']",Thirty-one subjects with an ART-suppressed plasma HIV RNA level of < 40 copies/mL and a CD4 ( + ) T-cell count of â‰¥350 cells/mm ( 3 ) for â‰¥1 year,C,"['receive raltegravir 400', 'daily or placebo', 'CONCLUSIONS Raltegravir']",raltegravir 400 mg twice daily or placebo for 24 weeks,C,"['low-level viral replication', '2-long terminal repeat', 'The median duration of ART suppression', 'the level of 2-LTR circles', 'group .

OBJECTIVES We sought to determine the effect of pravastatin on recurrent cardiovascular events in women with average cholesterol levels after myocardial infarction ( MI ). BACKGROUND Little information is available on the effectiveness of lipid lowering in secondary prevention of coronary heart disease ( CHD ) in women ; in particular, those with CHD and average cholesterol levels. METHODS In the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events ( CARE ) trial, 576 postmenopausal women, between 3 and 20 months after MI, with a total cholesterol level < 240 mg/dl and a low density lipoprotein cholesterol level 115 to 174 mg/dl, were randomized to receive pravastatin 40 mg/day or matching placebo for a median follow-up period of 5 years. The main outcome measures were combined coronary events ( coronary death, nonfatal MI, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty [ PTCA ] or coronary artery bypass graft surgery [ CABG ] ), the primary trial end point ( coronary death or nonfatal MI ) and stroke. RESULTS Women treated with pravastatin had a risk reduction of 43 % for the primary end point ( p = 0.035 ), 46 % for combined coronary events ( p = 0.001 ), 48 % for PTCA ( p = 0.025 ), 40 % for CABG ( p = 0.14 ) and 56 % for stroke ( p = 0.07 ). The 3,583 men in the CARE trial also showed a reduction in risk, but the magnitude tended to be less. Pravastatin improved plasma lipids similarly in men and women. There were no differences in risk of coronary events in the placebo group between men and women. Minor differences between men and women were present in baseline characteristics and treatment for MI, in general, conferring a higher risk status and a lower incidence of CABG in the women.

Caregivers were randomized to 12 sessions of an individualized parent education intervention aimed at improving parental responsiveness or to a monitoring control group involving 4 sessions of behavioral support. Parental responsiveness and child outcomes were measured at three time points: at beginning and end of the 3-month treatment and at 12-months post-study entry. Parental responsiveness improved significantly in the treatment group but not the control group. However, parental responsiveness was not fully maintained at follow up. There were no treatment effects on child outcomes of joint attention or language. Children in both groups made significant developmental gains in cognition and language skills over one year.

To determine the effectiveness of nicotinic acid in dyslipidemic patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, 13 patients were treated in a randomized crossover trial. Patients received either nicotinic acid ( 1.5 g three times daily ) or no therapy ( control period ) for 8 weeks each. Compared with the control period, nicotinic acid therapy reduced the plasma total cholesterol level by 24 %, plasma triglyceride level by 45 %, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level by 58 %, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level by 15 %, and it increased the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level by 34 %. However, nicotinic acid therapy resulted in the deterioration of glycemic control, as evidenced by a 16 % increase in mean plasma glucose concentrations, a 21 % increase in glycosylated hemoglobin levels, and the induction of marked glycosuria in some patients. Furthermore, a consistent increase in plasma uric acid levels was observed. Therefore, despite improvement in lipid and lipoprotein concentrations, because of worsening hyperglycemia and the development of hyperuricemia, nicotinic acid must be used with caution in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus with dyslipidemia. We suggest that the drug not be used as a first-line hypolipidemic drug in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.","['non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus .', 'dyslipidemic patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus , 13 patients were treated in a randomized crossover trial .', 'patients', 'patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus .']",13 dyslipidemic patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus,C,"['Nicotinic acid', 'nicotinic acid', 'nicotinic acid', 'no therapy', 'nicotinic acid', 'nicotinic acid']",nicotinic acid (1.5 g three times daily) or no therapy (control period) for 8 weeks each,C,"['plasma total cholesterol level', 'plasma triglyceride level', 'very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level', 'low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level', 'high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level', 'deterioration of glycemic control', 'mean plasma glucose concentrations', 'glycosylated hemoglobin levels', 'marked glycosuria', 'plasma uric acid levels', 'lipid and lipoprotein concentrations', 'hyperglycemia', 'hyperuricemia']","nicotinic acid therapy reduced the plasma total cholesterol level by 24%, plasma triglyceride level by 45%, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level by 58%, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level by 15%, and it increased the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level by 34%; deterioration of glycemic control with a 16% increase in mean plasma glucose concentrations, a 21% increase in glycosylated hemoglobin levels, and the induction of marked glycosuria in some patients; consistent increase in plasma uric acid levels",C,O_prediction contains outcomes AND results,0.9408631769002584,0.8888888888888888,0.26666666666666666,0.41025641025641024,66.66666666666666,0.111388881905377,0.2352941176470588,0.3333333333333333,0.2758620689655172,100.0,0.2395811793878958,0.5063291139240507,0.8695652173913043,0.6400000000000001,88.0

All children were treated with 40 mg praziquantel/kg at the start of the study. Six months later, the children in group A were re-treated with the same dose of praziquantel, while the children in group B were given placebos. All children were followed up three, six and 12 months after the initial treatment, morbidity being clinically evaluated at the six- and 12-month follow-ups. The results show that, in both groups of children, there were significant reductions in splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and subjective symptoms of morbidity six and 12 months after initial treatment. However, there were no significant differences, between the two groups, in the prevalences of these symptoms of morbidity. It therefore appears that once-yearly treatment of children, in this and similar endemic areas, is sufficient to reduce schistosomiasis morbidity to, and maintain it at, a tolerable level.","['community-based', 'schoolchildren in Zambia .', 'community-based', 'an area of Zambia endemic for schistosomiasis .', 'Schistosoma mansoni', '377 infected children , aged seven to 19 years', 'All children were treated with 40 mg praziquantel/kg at the start of the study .', 'children', 'children', 'children', 'children', 'children , in this and similar endemic areas']","377 infected children, aged seven to 19 years, in an area of Zambia endemic for schistosomiasis",C,"['praziquantel', 'praziquantel', 'praziquantel/kg', 'praziquantel', 'placebos .']",Group A: 190 children treated with 40 mg praziquantel/kg at the start of the study and re-treated with the same dose six months later; Group B: 187 children treated with 40 mg praziquantel/kg at the start of the study and given placebos six months later,C,"['morbidity', 'splenomegaly , hepatomegaly , and subjective symptoms of morbidity', 'morbidity .']","significant reductions in splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and subjective symptoms of morbidity six and 12 months after initial treatment in both groups; no significant differences between the two groups in the prevalences of these symptoms of morbidity",C,O_prediction contains outcomes AND results,0.8980192971790859,0.625,0.2,0.30303030303030304,42.30769230769231,0.0694958657357882,0.0833333333333333,0.6666666666666666,0.1481481481481481,100.0,0.29621081098047,0.2285714285714285,0.8888888888888888,0.3636363636363636,100.0
10148879,"Comparison of patient-controlled and nurse-administered analgesia using intravenous fentanyl during labor. Preliminary observations have shown that fentanyl citrate, a potent narcotic, is helpful during labor without undue side effects. This randomized prospective investigation compared the patient-controlled administration of fentanyl with that of administration by nurses on request. Eighty healthy women beginning active labor ( cervical dilation 4 cm ) at term were assigned to receive fentanyl intravenously by either patient-controlled administration ( n=37 ) or nurse administration on demand ( n=43 ). Pain intensity measurements during early and late labor revealed the degree of analgesia to be the same in both groups. The delay in setting up the infusion system and the short time between requesting analgesia and vaginal delivery were limitations with self-administration. Maternal oversedation and vomiting did not occur. Neonatal naloxone therapy was used infrequently, umbilical serum levels of fentanyl were the same in both groups, and postnatal neuroadaptive testing revealed comparable results in both groups. Despite the usefulness of fentanyl during labor, administration by the patient had no advantages over administration by the nurses in significantly reducing drug use, improving pain relief, or avoiding drowsiness.","['during labor .', 'Eighty healthy women beginning active labor ( cervical dilation 4 cm ) at term were assigned to receive fentanyl intravenously by either patient-controlled administration ( n=37 ) or nurse administration on demand ( n=43 )']",Eighty healthy women beginning active labor (cervical dilation 4 cm) at term,C,"['patient-controlled and nurse-administered analgesia', 'fentanyl citrate', 'patient-controlled administration of fentanyl', 'administration by nurses on request .', 'fentanyl intravenously by either patient-controlled administration ( n=37 ) or nurse administration on demand', 'administration by the patient', 'administration by the nurses']",fentanyl intravenously by either patient-controlled administration (n=37) or nurse administration on demand (n=43),C,"['Comparison', 'Pain intensity measurements', 'degree of analgesia', 'setting up the infusion system', 'time between requesting analgesia and vaginal delivery', 'Maternal oversedation and vomiting', 'Neonatal naloxone therapy', 'umbilical serum levels of fentanyl', 'postnatal neuroadaptive testing', 'drug use , improving pain relief , or avoiding drowsiness .']","Pain intensity measurements during early and late labor, delay in setting up the infusion system, time between requesting analgesia and vaginal delivery, maternal oversedation and vomiting, neonatal naloxone therapy, umbilical serum levels of fentanyl, postnatal neuroadaptive testing",C,O_Labels is probably partially incorrect/imprecise,1.1167470964180197,1.0,0.35294117647058826,0.5217391304347826,52.0,0.917352250136947,0.875,0.35,0.4999999999999999,68.75,0.4746449156847103,0.8108108108108109,0.7142857142857143,0.759493670886076,75.0
19304046,"Mastication and late mandibular fracture after surgery of impacted third molars associated with no gross pathology. PURPOSE This study was undertaken with the null hypothesis that in patients, fully denate or with 1 or 2 teeth missing and older than 25 years, mastication does not affect late mandibular fracture after surgical removal of impacted third molars ( M3s ) associated with no gross pathology. MATERIALS AND METHODS Five hundred sixty patients, fully dentate or with 1 or 2 teeth missing and older than 25 years who had no gross pathology associated with their impacted lower M3s, were recruited in this study. They were operated on under local anesthesia using a standard technique and randomly assigned into 2 groups for nonroutine ( NR group ) and routine ( R group ) postoperative instructions. In the NR group, patients were postoperatively educated in the possibility of mandibular fracture and were given an emphasis on the necessity of limiting mastication to a soft diet for 4 weeks. In the R group, patients were given no such education or emphasis. Patients were followed up for 2 months, and data concerning patients ' age and gender ; tooth position, angulation, and depth ; date and site of surgery ; and occurrence of late mandibular fracture were recorded and statistically analyzed. A value of P less than.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS In no patient group was there a late mandibular fracture recorded. All patients completed the follow-up period, and most of the R group patients had normal eating habits 10 to 14 days after surgery. In no patient group was there a statistically significant difference in relation to gender ( P =.735 ), site of surgery ( P =.552 ), class horizontal space available ( P =.427 ), class highest portion of the M3 crown ( P =.424 ), angulations of the teeth ( P =.925 ), and severity of impaction ( P =.445 ). CONCLUSIONS In patients, fully dentate or with 1 or 2 teeth missing and older than 25 years who have no jawbone atrophy and no systemic problems that may impair bone strength, mastication seems not to affect late mandibular fracture after surgical removal of impacted M3s associated with no gross pathology. The remote possible risk of the late fracture shown in our patients indicates the need for no special precautions.","['impacted third molars associated with no gross pathology .', 'patients , fully denate or with 1 or 2 teeth missing and older than 25 years', 'after surgical removal of impacted third molars ( M3s ) associated with no gross pathology .', 'Five hundred sixty patients , fully dentate or with 1 or 2 teeth missing and older than 25 years who had no gross pathology associated with their impacted lower M3s', 'patients , fully dentate or with 1 or 2 teeth missing and older than 25 years who have no jawbone atrophy and no systemic problems that may impair bone strength']","Five hundred sixty patients, fully dentate or with 1 or 2 teeth missing and older than 25 years who had no gross pathology associated with their impacted lower M3s",C,"['surgery', 'surgical removal', 'operated on', 'local anesthesia', 'surgery ;']","Patients were operated on under local anesthesia using a standard technique and randomly assigned into 2 groups for nonroutine (NR group) and routine (R group) postoperative instructions.

7635420,"Synthesis of interleukin-1 beta in primary biliary cirrhosis: relationship to treatment with methotrexate or colchicine and disease progression. Primary biliary cirrhosis ( PBC ) is a chronic, progressive, cholestatic liver disease. Interleukin-1 beta ( IL-1 beta ) may play a role in the pathogenesis of PBC by contributing to altered immune function and fibrosis. Colchicine or methotrexate has some beneficial effects in the treatment of PBC, and also affects interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ). Therefore, we prospectively studied the synthesis of IL-1 beta by peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) from 42 patients with PBC entered into a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy controlled trial of colchicine and methotrexate. PBMC obtained at entry, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months were stimulated to produce IL-1 beta with phytohemagglutinin ( PHA ), lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ), Staphylococcus epidermidis, recombinant IL-2, or mitochondrial antigen. Patients in the two treatment groups did not differ at entry in biochemical measures or liver histological stage. Over 24 months in both groups, serum bilirubin and histologic stage remained stable and alkaline phosphatase decreased significantly. For all patients, synthesis of IL-1 beta increased constitutively and in response to immune-mediated stimulants ( PHA, IL-2, and mitochondrial antigen ) but not the bacterial stimulants LPS or S epidermidis. Compared with levels of IL-1 beta at entry, PHA induced increases for patients treated with methotrexate ( 12, 18, and 24 months ) or colchicine ( 18 and 24 months ). At 24 months, IL-2-induced IL-1 beta synthesis was increased in patients treated with methotrexate, whereas S epidermidis-induced IL-1 beta was enhanced in colchicine-treated patients. Before treatment, IL-1 beta production did not relate to severity of disease except in response to S epidermidis.","['primary biliary cirrhosis :', 'Primary biliary cirrhosis ( PBC ) is a chronic , progressive , cholestatic liver disease .', 'from 42 patients with PBC']",42 patients with Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC),C,"['methotrexate or colchicine', 'Colchicine or methotrexate', 'colchicine and methotrexate .', 'methotrexate', 'colchicine-treated']",Treatment with methotrexate or colchicine,C,"['Interleukin-1 beta ( IL-1 beta )', 'interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) .', 'IL-1 beta', 'biochemical measures or liver histological stage .', 'serum bilirubin and histologic stage', 'alkaline phosphatase', 'synthesis of IL-1 beta', 'IL-2-induced IL-1 beta synthesis', 'S epidermidis-induced IL-1 beta']","Over 24 months in both groups, serum bilirubin and histologic stage remained stable and alkaline phosphatase decreased significantly.

Young injection drug users ( IDUs ) who are not infected with HIV or hepatitis C virus are at great risk of acquiring one or both of these infections through their sexual or injection behaviors. We describe the development of a behavioral intervention designed to decrease sexual and injection risk behaviors among young IDUs. The intervention was developed through a dynamic and iterative process that involved extensive development activities, focus groups with the target population to pilot individual activities and intervention sessions, and later, pilot testing of the entire intervention. The six-session intervention that emerged from the development process relied on both social-cognitive theories and peer influence models. We also designed a control intervention, trained facilitators to deliver the interventions, and conducted quality assurance of intervention delivery. To better understand intervention trial findings, we asked participants about their intervention experiences and examined potential contamination across arms. Both interventions were delivered with high fidelity and participants in both groups reported positive experiences. More perceived impact was reported for injection risk behaviors than for sexual risk behaviors among participants in the intervention arm. Minimal evidence of contamination was found.

OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a variety of tests in differentiating simulating test performances from genuine memory-impaired and normal ( control ) test performances. DESIGN A simulation design was implemented, based on an analogue design in which normal participants were given experimental instructions to feign a mental impairment and are compared to ( a ) other normal participants with instructions to perform honestly, and ( b ) a comparison group, for example, acquired brain-injured persons, with similar instructions. METHOD Forty individuals comprised the simulating and control group and all participants were randomly assigned to the simulating and control groups. Twenty memory-impaired patients, all of whom had been diagnosed as suffering from a memory impairment following acquired brain damage, participated as the memory-impaired control group. The simulation group was directed to imitate a person with a memory impairment. The primary outcome measure involved identifying those tests, if any, where simulators were significantly different from normal and memory-impaired participants. RESULTS On 5 of the 15 tasks administered, simulators performed significantly differently from normal and memory-impaired participants. Of these 5 tasks, the coin-in-the-hand, when administered in conjunction with the autobiographical interview, identified 95 per cent of the simulators without misclassifying any of the memory-impaired or normal participants.

24281134,"Predictors of postdischarge outcomes from information acquired shortly after admission for acute heart failure: a report from the Placebo-Controlled Randomized Study of the Selective A1 Adenosine Receptor Antagonist Rolofylline for Patients Hospitalized With Acute Decompensated Heart Failure and Volume Overload to Assess Treatment Effect on Congestion and Renal Function ( PROTECT ) Study. BACKGROUND Acute heart failure is a common reason for admission, and outcome is often poor. Improved prognostic risk stratification may assist in the design of future trials and in patient management. Using data from a large randomized trial, we explored the prognostic value of clinical variables, measured at hospital admission for acute heart failure, to determine whether a few selected variables were inferior to an extended data set. METHODS AND RESULTS The prognostic model included 37 clinical characteristics collected at baseline in PROTECT, a study comparing rolofylline and placebo in 2033 patients admitted with acute heart failure. Prespecified outcomes at 30 days were death or rehospitalization for any reason ; death or rehospitalization for cardiovascular or renal reasons ; and, at both 30 and 180 days, all-cause mortality. No variable had a c-index > 0.70, and few had values > 0.60 ; c-indices were lower for composite outcomes than for mortality. Blood urea was generally the strongest single predictor. Eighteen variables contributed independent prognostic information, but a reduced model using only 8 items ( age, previous heart failure hospitalization, peripheral edema, systolic blood pressure, serum sodium, urea, creatinine, and albumin ) performed similarly. For prediction of all-cause mortality at 180 days, the model c-index using all variables was 0.72 and for the simplified model, also 0.72. CONCLUSIONS A few simple clinical variables measured on admission in patients with acute heart failure predict a variety of adverse outcomes with accuracy similar to more complex models.

23716409,"The effectiveness of educational interventions to enhance the adoption of fee-based arsenic testing in Bangladesh: a cluster randomized controlled trial. Arsenic ( As ) testing could help 22 million people, using drinking water sources that exceed the Bangladesh As standard, to identify safe sources. A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of household education and local media in the increasing demand for fee-based As testing. Randomly selected households ( N = 452 ) were divided into three interventions implemented by community workers: 1 ) fee-based As testing with household education ( HE ) ; 2 ) fee-based As testing with household education and a local media campaign ( HELM ) ; and 3 ) fee-based As testing alone ( Control ). The fee for the As test was US $ 0.28, higher than the cost of the test ( US $ 0.16 ). Of households with untested wells, 93 % in both intervention groups HE and HELM purchased an As test, whereas only 53 % in the control group.

22565161,"Once-daily MMX ( Â® ) mesalamine for endoscopic maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis. OBJECTIVES Treatment with mesalamine to maintain endoscopic remission ( mucosal healing ) of ulcerative colitis ( UC ) has been shown to reduce the risk of relapse and is the recommended first-line maintenance therapy. To improve treatment adherence, a mesalamine formulation that can be administered once-daily, MMX ( Â® ) mesalamine ( Lialda ; Shire Pharmaceuticals LLC, Wayne, PA ), was developed. This study was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of once-daily MMX mesalamine compared with twice-daily delayed-release mesalamine ( Asacol ; Warner Chilcott, Dublin, Ireland ) for maintaining endoscopic remission in patients with UC. METHODS A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 6-month, active-control trial was conducted to assess the non-inferiority of once-daily MMX mesalamine 2.4 g/day compared with twice-daily delayed-release mesalamine at a total daily dose of 1.6 g/day in patients with UC in endoscopic remission. The primary end point was maintenance of endoscopic remission at month 6 in the per-protocol ( PP ) population. RESULTS Overall, 826 patients were randomized and dosed. The primary objective ( non-inferiority ) was met. At month 6, 83.7 and 77.8 % of patients receiving MMX mesalamine in the PP and intent-to-treat ( ITT ) populations, respectively, had maintained endoscopic remission compared with 81.5 % ( PP ) and 76.9 % ( ITT ) of patients receiving delayed-release mesalamine ( 95 % confidence interval for difference: -3.9 %, 8.1 % ( PP ) ; -5.0 %, 6.9 % ( ITT ) ). Time to relapse was not significantly different between the two treatment groups ( log-rank test, P=0.5116 ( PP ) ; P=0.5455 ( ITT ) ). The proportion of patients with adverse events was 37.1 and 36.0 % in patients receiving MMX mesalamine and delayed-release mesalamine, respectively.

20513659,"Magnocellular visual evoked potential delay with high autism spectrum quotient yields a neural mechanism for altered perception. Everyone has autistic characteristics to a greater or lesser degree, encapsulated in the Autism Spectrum Quotient, a scale that measures the degree to which an adult of normal intelligence displays traits associated with autism spectrum disorders. Recent psychophysical analyses of autism spectrum disorders point to superior local processing, and impaired or ignored global and contextual processing. The aim of this study was to test whether low- and high-scoring individuals on the Autism Spectrum Quotient differ on a measure of local and global processing, motion processing and visual pathway integrity. Fifteen low-scoring individuals and 14 high-scoring individuals derived from a normal population participated in the study. The results indicate that the initial cortical response to the magnocellular afferents is weaker at low contrast in the high autistic tendency group and that a second-order response, reflecting magnocellular activity, demonstrated a delay for high versus low scorers when the parvocellular pathway was also active in response to a high contrast stimulus. High-scoring individuals also demonstrated difficulty in identifying the global components of locally salient hierarchical Navon figures. Furthermore, cross-validated discriminant analysis, using four physiologically and three psychophysically derived parameters, correctly classified 83 % of individuals who scored either high or low on the Autism Spectrum Quotient. These findings in the group scoring high on the Autism Spectrum Quotient indicate that a delay in primary visual/prestriate cortical processing of magnocellular input diminishes the advantage of its early arrival to primary visual cortex. This appears to be associated with impaired global visual perception, predicting with high accuracy behavioural tendencies associated with autism spectrum disorders. It has been proposed that perceptual impairment in autism may be attributed to a dysfunction of horizontal connections within early visual areas, presumably parvocellular in nature. However, the timing of such form processing aberrations is much later than the timing of abnormal magnocellular visual processing measured directly here. Thus it is proposed that a magnocellular processing delay decreases the ability of autistic individuals to benefit perceptually from feedback normally associated with the magnocellular advantage.","['high autism spectrum quotient', 'adult of normal intelligence', 'low- and high-scoring individuals on the Autism Spectrum Quotient', 'Fifteen low-scoring individuals and 14 high-scoring individuals derived from a normal population participated in the study .', 'Autism Spectrum Quotient', 'autistic individuals']",Fifteen low-scoring individuals and 14 high-scoring individuals derived from a normal population,C,"['Magnocellular visual', 'low-', 'high-scoring individuals on the Autism Spectrum Quotient', 'local and global processing , motion processing and visual pathway integrity .']","Participants were tested on a measure of local and global processing, motion processing and visual pathway integrity",P,"['altered perception .', 'Autism Spectrum Quotient', 'local and global processing', 'cortical response', 'a delay', 'identifying the global components', 'impaired global visual perception', 'behavioural tendencies']",Initial cortical response to the magnocellular afferents is weaker at low contrast in the high autistic tendency group; second-order response demonstrated a delay for high versus low scorers when the parvocellular pathway was also active in response to a high contrast stimulus; high-scoring individuals demonstrated difficulty in identifying the global components of locally salient hierarchical Navon figures; cross-validated discriminant analysis correctly classified 83% of individuals who scored either high or low on the Autism Spectrum Quotient,P,,1.1167470964180197,1.0,0.34146341463414637,0.5090909090909091,50.0,0.6894782559676486,0.6470588235294118,0.5238095238095238,0.5789473684210527,46.66666666666666,0.1228274570518328,0.1012658227848101,0.3478260869565217,0.1568627450980392,52.94117647058824
23135337,"The paroxetine 352 bipolar trial: A study in medical ghostwriting. BACKGROUND The problem of ghostwriting in corporate-sponsored clinical trials is of concern to medicine, bioethics, and government agencies. We present a study of the ghostwritten archival report of an industry-sponsored trial comparing antidepressant treatments for bipolar depression: GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) paroxetine study 352. This analysis is based upon publicly available evidence presented in a complaint of research misconduct filed with the Office of Research Integrity of the Department of Health and Human Services. OBJECTIVES We performed a deconstruction of the published study to show how primary and secondary outcome analyses were conflated, turning a 'negative ' clinical trial into a 'positive ' study - with conclusions and recommendations that could adversely affect patient health. METHODS The paroxetine 352 study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 19-site trial comparing paroxetine and imipramine in 117 patients with bipolar type I major depressive episode which was unresponsive to prior lithium carbonate therapy. RESULTS Analysis of the primary outcome measures found no statistically significant difference between paroxetine or imipramine versus placebo.

12151468,"Risperidone in children with autism and serious behavioral problems. BACKGROUND Atypical antipsychotic agents, which block postsynaptic dopamine and serotonin receptors, have advantages over traditional antipsychotic medications in the treatment of adults with schizophrenia and may be beneficial in children with autistic disorder who have serious behavioral disturbances. However, data on the safety and efficacy of atypical antipsychotic agents in children are limited. METHODS We conducted a multisite, randomized, double-blind trial of risperidone as compared with placebo for the treatment of autistic disorder accompanied by severe tantrums, aggression, or self-injurious behavior in children 5 to 17 years old. The primary outcome measures were the score on the Irritability subscale of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist and the rating on the Clinical Global Impressions - Improvement ( CGI-I ) scale at eight weeks. RESULTS A total of 101 children ( 82 boys and 19 girls ; mean [ +/-SD ] age, 8.8+/-2.7 years ) were randomly assigned to receive risperidone ( 49 children ) or placebo ( 52 ). Treatment with risperidone for eight weeks ( dose range, 0.5 to 3.5 mg per day ) resulted in a 56.9 percent reduction in the Irritability score, as compared with a 14.1 percent decrease in the placebo group ( P < 0.001 ). The rate of a positive response, defined as at least a 25 percent decrease in the Irritability score and a rating of much improved or very much improved on the CGI-I scale, was 69 percent in the risperidone group ( 34 of 49 children had a positive response ) and 12 percent in the placebo group ( 6 of 52, P < 0.001 ). Risperidone therapy was associated with an average weight gain of 2.7+/-2.9 kg, as compared with 0.8+/-2.2 kg with placebo ( P < 0.001 ). Increased appetite, fatigue, drowsiness, dizziness, and drooling were more common in the risperidone group than in the placebo group ( P < 0.05 for each comparison ). In two thirds of the children with a positive response to risperidone at eight weeks ( 23 of 34 ), the benefit was maintained at six months. CONCLUSIONS Risperidone was effective and well tolerated for the treatment of tantrums, aggression, or self-injurious behavior in children with autistic disorder.

26725450,"Safety and immunogenicity of a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored Ebola vaccine in healthy adults: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding, phase 1/2a study. BACKGROUND The ongoing Ebola outbreak led to accelerated efforts to test vaccine candidates. On the basis of a request by WHO, we aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the monovalent, recombinant, chimpanzee adenovirus type-3 vector-based Ebola Zaire vaccine ( ChAd3-EBO-Z ). METHODS We did this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding, phase 1/2a trial at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, Lausanne, Switzerland. Participants ( aged 18-65 years ) were randomly assigned ( 2:2:1 ), via two computer-generated randomisation lists for individuals potentially deployed in endemic areas and those not deployed, to receive a single intramuscular dose of high-dose vaccine ( 5 Ã— 10 ( 10 ) viral particles ), low-dose vaccine ( 2Â·5 Ã— 10 ( 10 ) viral particles ), or placebo. Deployed participants were allocated to only the vaccine groups. Group allocation was concealed from non-deployed participants, investigators, and outcome assessors. The safety evaluation was not masked for potentially deployed participants, who were therefore not included in the safety analysis for comparison between the vaccine doses and placebo, but were pooled with the non-deployed group to compare immunogenicity. The main objectives were safety and immunogenicity of ChAd3-EBO-Z. We did analysis by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02289027. FINDINGS Between Oct 24, 2014, and June 22, 2015, we randomly assigned 120 participants, of whom 18 ( 15 % ) were potentially deployed and 102 ( 85 % ) were non-deployed, to receive high-dose vaccine ( n=49 ), low-dose vaccine ( n=51 ), or placebo ( n=20 ). Participants were followed up for 6 months. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported. We recorded local adverse events in 30 ( 75 % ) of 40 participants in the high-dose group, 33 ( 79 % ) of 42 participants in the low-dose group, and five ( 25 % ) of 20 participants in the placebo group. Fatigue or malaise was the most common systemic adverse event, reported in 25 ( 62 % ) participants in the high-dose group, 25 ( 60 % ) participants in the low-dose group, and five ( 25 % ) participants in the placebo group, followed by headache, reported in 23 ( 57 % ), 25 ( 60 % ), and three ( 15 % ) participants, respectively. Fever occurred 24 h after injection in 12 ( 30 % ) participants in the high-dose group and 11 ( 26 % ) participants in the low-dose group versus one ( 5 % ) participant in the placebo group. Geometric mean concentrations of IgG antibodies against Ebola glycoprotein peaked on day 28 at 51 Î¼g/mL ( 95 % CI 41Â·1-63Â·3 ) in the high-dose group, 44Â·9 Î¼g/mL ( 25Â·8-56Â·3 ) in the low-dose group, and 5Â·2 Î¼g/mL ( 3Â·5-7Â·6 ) in the placebo group, with respective response rates of 96 % ( 95 % CI 85Â·7-99Â·5 ), 96 % ( 86Â·5-99Â·5 ), and 5 % ( 0Â·1-24Â·9 ). Geometric mean concentrations decreased by day 180 to 25Â·5 Î¼g/mL ( 95 % CI 20Â·6-31Â·5 ) in the high-dose group, 22Â·1 Î¼g/mL ( 19Â·3-28Â·6 ) in the low-dose group, and 3Â·2 Î¼g/mL ( 2Â·4-4Â·9 ) in the placebo group. 28 ( 57 % ) participants given high-dose vaccine and 31 ( 61 % ) participants given low-dose vaccine developed glycoprotein-specific CD4 cell responses, and 33 ( 67 % ) and 35 ( 69 % ), respectively, developed CD8 responses. INTERPRETATION ChAd3-EBO-Z was safe and well tolerated, although mild to moderate systemic adverse events were common. A single dose was immunogenic in almost all vaccine recipients. Antibody responses were still significantly present at 6 months. There was no significant difference between doses for safety and immunogenicity outcomes. This acceptable safety profile provides a reliable basis to proceed with phase 2 and phase 3 efficacy trials in Africa.

16238662,"A randomised controlled trial of a CBT intervention for anxiety in children with Asperger syndrome. BACKGROUND The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief CBT intervention for anxiety with children diagnosed with Asperger syndrome ( AS ). A second interest was to evaluate whether more intensive parent involvement would increase the child 's ability to manage anxiety outside of the clinic setting. METHODS Seventy-one children aged ten to twelve years were recruited to participate in the anxiety programme. All children were diagnosed with AS and the presence of anxiety symptoms was accepted on parent report via brief interview. Children were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: intervention for child only, intervention for child and parent, wait-list control. RESULTS The two intervention groups demonstrated significant decreases in parent-reported anxiety symptoms at follow-up and a significant increase in the child 's ability to generate positive strategies in an anxiety-provoking situation. There were a number of significant differences between the two interventions to suggest parent involvement as beneficial. CONCLUSIONS The sample of children with AS in this study presented with a profile of anxiety similar to a sample of clinically diagnosed anxious children. The intervention was endorsed by parents as a useful programme for children diagnosed with Asperger syndrome and exhibiting anxiety symptoms, and active parent involvement enhanced the usefulness of the programme.

METHODS Forty-three patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD, age 60 Â± 9 years, FEV1 37 Â± 16 % pred. ) and indications for LTOT were recruited during pulmonary rehabilitation for this cross-over study. After an initial maximal incremental cycle test, all patients performed 4 cycling endurance time tests at 70 % of their peak work rate ( twice with the Oxymizer and twice with a CNC, in reverse order ). RESULTS The endurance time was significantly higher when patients cycled while using the Oxymizer in comparison to while using the CNC [ 858 Â± 754 vs. 766 Â± 652 s ; between-group difference 92 s ( 95 % confidence interval 32-152 ), p < 0.001 ]. In addition to a longer cycling duration, O2 saturation at isotime was significantly higher with the Oxymizer ( 93.5 Â± 5.4 vs. 90.4 Â± 5.3 % ; p = 0.027 ). Furthermore, there was a positive correlation ( r = 0.427, p = 0.002 ) between the O2 flow rate and improvements in the constant work rate test, showing greater improvements in favor of the Oxymizer in patients with a higher demand for O2 ( â‰¥ 4 liters/min ). CONCLUSION We show that O2 delivery via the Oxymizer is superior to a CNC with regard to endurance capacity and oxygenation during exercise in patients with severe COPD. It seems that patients with a higher demand for O2 ( â‰¥ 4 liters/min ), in particular, may benefit more from the use of the Oxymizer.","['hypoxemic COPD patients :', 'METHODS Forty-three patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD , age 60 Ã‚Â± 9 years , FEV1 37 Ã‚Â± 16 % pred . ) and indications for LTOT were recruited during pulmonary rehabilitation for this cross-over study', 'exercise in patients with severe']","Forty-three patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, age 60 Â± 9 years, FEV1 37 Â± 16 % pred.) and indications for LTOT",C,"['oxygen reservoir cannula versus a conventional nasal cannula', 'OxymizerÃ‚Â®', 'the Oxymizer', 'a conventional nasal cannula ( CNC )', 'performed 4 cycling endurance time tests', 'the Oxymizer', 'with a CNC', 'the Oxymizer', 'the CNC', 'of the Oxymizer', 'delivery via the', 'superior', 'use of the']",Oxymizer nasal cannula vs. conventional nasal cannula (CNC) during cycling endurance time tests at 70% of their peak work rate,C,"['on endurance time', 'The endurance time', 'to a longer cycling duration , O2 saturation at isotime', 'between the O2 flow rate and improvements in the constant work rate', 'regard to endurance capacity and oxygenation during']","Endurance time, O2 saturation at isotime, correlation between O2 flow rate and improvements in the constant work rate test",C,,0.6417294634365444,1.0,0.5365853658536586,0.6984126984126985,70.96774193548387,0.409804357093356,0.55,0.2682926829268293,0.360655737704918,50.0,0.7082989789343547,0.8947368421052632,0.5,0.6415094339622641,62.5

24713222,"Hemodialysis catheter design and catheter performance: a randomized controlled trial. BACKGROUND A complication of long-term use of tunneled cuffed catheters for hemodialysis is the high rate of infection and thrombus-related dysfunction. Specific mechanical features of tunneled cuffed catheters may improve hemodynamic performance and decrease thrombosis and infection rates. However, there currently is no proven advantage of one design over another. STUDY DESIGN Single-center randomized clinical trial. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS 302 hemodialysis patients who required a tunneled cuffed catheter as temporary or definite vascular access. INTERVENTION Palindrome Symmetric Tip Dialysis Catheter or HemoStar Long-Term Hemodialysis Catheter. OUTCOMES & MEASUREMENTS The primary end point was primary assisted patency. Secondary end points were incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections ( CRBSIs ), thrombosis, and 2 indicators of rheologic function: mean effective blood flow rate and urokinase use. RESULTS Mean primary assisted patency was 135.9 days for Palindrome and 136.5 days for HemoStar ( P=0.8 ). Definite CRBSI occurred in 0.24 and 0.10/1,000 catheter-days for Palindrome and HemoStar, respectively ( P=0.3 ). Removal rates for thrombosis that could not be resolved with thrombolysis were 0.53 and 0.43/1,000 catheter-days for Palindrome and HemoStar, respectively ( P=0.7 ). Urokinase use was lower for Palindrome than for HemoStar, as evidenced by a lower number of urokinase infusions/1,000 catheter-days ( 17 and 35 ; P < 0.001 ) and higher number of catheters that never required thrombolysis ( 58 % and 45 % ; P=0.03 ). Mean effective blood flow rate was higher for Palindrome than for HemoStar ( 333 and 304mL/min ; P < 0.001 ). LIMITATIONS Single-center nonblinded trial. CONCLUSIONS Primary assisted patency and incidence of infection and thrombosis were similar for both catheter types. The Palindrome catheter required less thrombolysis and achieved higher blood flow rates than the HemoStar catheter. These findings suggest that mechanical catheter design may improve catheter rheology, but does not affect risks for thrombosis and infection and hence catheter survival.","['Hemodialysis catheter design and catheter performance :', '302 hemodialysis patients who required a tunneled cuffed catheter as temporary or definite vascular access .']",302 hemodialysis patients who required a tunneled cuffed catheter as temporary or definite vascular access,C,"['tunneled cuffed catheters', 'tunneled cuffed catheters', 'tunneled cuffed catheter', 'Palindrome Symmetric Tip Dialysis Catheter or HemoStar Long-Term Hemodialysis Catheter .', 'Palindrome', 'HemoStar']",Palindrome Symmetric Tip Dialysis Catheter or HemoStar Long-Term Hemodialysis Catheter,C,"['infection', 'thrombus-related dysfunction .', 'primary assisted patency .', 'incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections ( CRBSIs ) , thrombosis , and 2 indicators of rheologic function : mean effective blood flow rate and urokinase use .', 'Mean primary assisted patency', 'CRBSI', 'Removal rates for thrombosis', 'Urokinase use', 'urokinase infusions/1,000', 'catheters that never required thrombolysis', 'Mean effective blood flow rate', 'Primary assisted patency and incidence of infection and thrombosis', 'thrombolysis', 'blood flow rates', 'thrombosis and infection']","primary assisted patency, incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs), thrombosis, mean effective blood flow rate, and urokinase use",P,,1.044724709212835,1.0,0.7142857142857143,0.8333333333333333,78.57142857142857,1.0104745593220357,1.0,0.5,0.6666666666666666,75.0,0.6909148880330974,1.0,0.2714285714285714,0.4269662921348314,54.285714285714285

The influence of acute sleep deprivation during the first part of the night on 24-h blood pressure monitoring ( ABPM ) was studied in 36 never-treated mild to moderate hypertensive patients. According to a crossover design, they were randomized to have either sleep deprivation or a full night 's sleep 1 week apart, during which they were monitored with ABPM. Urine samples for analysis of nocturnal urinary excretion of norepinephrine were collected. During the sleep-deprivation day, both mean 24-h blood pressure and mean 24-h heart rate were higher in comparison with those recorded during the routine workday, the difference being more pronounced during the nighttime ( P <.01 ). Urinary excretion of norepinephrine showed a significant increase at night during sleep deprivation ( P <.05 ). Blood pressure and heart rate significantly increased in the morning after a sleep-insufficient night ( P <.05 ). These data suggest that lack of sleep in hypertensive patients may increase sympathetic nervous activity during the night and the following morning, leading to increased blood pressure and heart rate.

Long-term administration of a beta-carotene preparation derived from Dunaliella bardawil, a beta-carotene-rich algae, was studied in healthy young male volunteers. The daily administration of 60 mg of the beta-carotene preparation ( 30 mg of all-trans beta-carotene and 30 mg of 9-cis beta-carotene ) was performed and beta-carotene concentrations were determined in the plasma, red blood cells ( RBC ), platelets ( PLT ), and mononuclear cells ( MN ). The all-trans beta-carotene level increased four-, two-, and threefold the baseline in plasma, PLT, and MN, respectively. Basal levels of 9-cis beta-carotene in plasma, PLT, and MN were low and found as one-tenth, one-fifth, and one-fifth of all-trans beta-carotene, which increased three-, two-, and 1.5-fold the baseline, respectively. Plasma and RBC alpha-tocopherol levels were not changed by the intake of beta-carotene. No side effects or toxicities were documented in any of the subjects during the administration period.

15741753,"Phase III trial of satraplatin, an oral platinum plus prednisone vs. prednisone alone in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Satraplatin is a novel oral platinum ( IV ) complex that shows activity against hormone-refractory prostate cancer ( HRPC ) in cisplatin-resistant human tumor lines in phase I and phase II trials. A randomized multicenter phase III trial with a target sample size of 380 patients was initiated in men with HRPC. After 50 randomized patients, the trial was closed to further accrual by the sponsoring company. An ad hoc analysis of all available data is reported here. Eligibility criteria included pathological proof of prostate cancer, documented progression despite prior hormonal manipulation, WHO PS 0-2, and no daily intake of narcotic analgesics. Patients were randomized between satraplatin 100 mg/m ( 2 ) for 5 days plus prednisone 10 mg orally BID or prednisone alone. Compliance was excellent. 48/50 patients have progressed and 42 have died, mostly due to prostate cancer. Median overall survival was 14.9 months ( 95 % CI: 13.7-28.4 ) on the satraplatin plus prednisone arm and 11.9 months ( 95 % CI: 8.4-23.1 ) on prednisone alone ( hazard ratio, HR = 0.84, 95 % CI: 0.46-1.55 ). A > 50 % decrease in prostrate specific antigen ( PSA ) was seen in 9/27 ( 33.3 % ) in the satraplatin plus prednisone arm vs. 2/23 ( 8.7 % ) on the prednisone alone arm. Progression-free survival was 5.2 months ( 95 % CI: 2.8-13.7 ) on the satraplatin plus prednisone arm as compared to 2.5 months ( 95 % CI: 2.1- 4.7 ) on the prednisone alone arm ( HR = 0.50, 95 % CI: 0.28-0.92 ). This difference is statistically significant ( p = 0.023 ). Toxicity was generally minimal in both arms. This randomized comparison of a combination of satraplatin and prednisone versus prednisone alone supports the antitumor activity of the combination.

BACKGROUND Few investigations include both subjective and objective measurements of the effectiveness of treatments for osteoarthritis of the knee. Beneficial interventions may decrease the disability associated with osteoarthritis and the need for more invasive treatments. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of physical therapy for osteoarthritis of the knee, applied by experienced physical therapists with formal training in manual therapy. DESIGN Randomized, controlled clinical trial. SETTING Outpatient physical therapy department of a large military medical center. PATIENTS 83 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee who were randomly assigned to receive treatment ( n = 42 ; 15 men and 27 women [ mean age, 60 +/- 11 years ] ) or placebo ( n = 41 ; 19 men and 22 women [ mean age, 62 +/- 10 years ] ). INTERVENTION The treatment group received manual therapy, applied to the knee as well as to the lumbar spine, hip, and ankle as required, and performed a standardized knee exercise program in the clinic and at home. The placebo group had subtherapeutic ultrasound to the knee at an intensity of 0.1 W/cm2 with a 10 % pulsed mode. Both groups were treated at the clinic twice weekly for 4 weeks. MEASUREMENTS Distance walked in 6 minutes and sum of the function, pain, and stiffness subscores of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ). A tester who was blinded to group assignment made group comparisons at the initial visit ( before initiation of treatment ), 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 1 year. RESULTS Clinically and statistically significant improvements in 6-minute walk distance and WOMAC score at 4 weeks and 8 weeks were seen in the treatment group but not the placebo group. By 8 weeks, average 6-minute walk distances had improved by 13.1 % and WOMAC scores had improved by 55.8 % over baseline values in the treatment group ( P < 0.05 ). After controlling for potential confounding variables, the average distance walked in 6 minutes at 8 weeks among patients in the treatment group was 170 m ( 95 % CI, 71 to 270 m ) more than that in the placebo group and the average WOMAC scores were 599 mm higher ( 95 % CI, 197 to 1002 mm ). At 1 year, patients in the treatment group had clinically and statistically significant gains over baseline WOMAC scores and walking distance ; 20 % of patients in the placebo group and 5 % of patients in the treatment group had undergone knee arthroplasty.

20038728,"Acupuncture versus venlafaxine for the management of vasomotor symptoms in patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer: a randomized controlled trial. PURPOSE Vasomotor symptoms are common adverse effects of antiestrogen hormone treatment in conventional breast cancer care. Hormone replacement therapy is contraindicated in patients with breast cancer. Venlafaxine ( Effexor ), the therapy of choice for these symptoms, has numerous adverse effects. Recent studies suggest acupuncture may be effective in reducing vasomotor symptoms in menopausal women. This randomized controlled trial tested whether acupuncture reduces vasomotor symptoms and produces fewer adverse effects than venlafaxine. PATIENTS AND METHODS Fifty patients were randomly assigned to receive 12 weeks of acupuncture ( n = 25 ) or venlafaxine ( n = 25 ) treatment. Health outcomes were measured for up to 1 year post-treatment. RESULTS Both groups exhibited significant decreases in hot flashes, depressive symptoms, and other quality-of-life symptoms, including significant improvements in mental health from pre- to post-treatment. These changes were similar in both groups, indicating that acupuncture was as effective as venlafaxine. By 2 weeks post-treatment, the venlafaxine group experienced significant increases in hot flashes, whereas hot flashes in the acupuncture group remained at low levels. The venlafaxine group experienced 18 incidences of adverse effects ( eg, nausea, dry mouth, dizziness, anxiety ), whereas the acupuncture group experienced no negative adverse effects. Acupuncture had the additional benefit of increased sex drive in some women, and most reported an improvement in their energy, clarity of thought, and sense of well-being. CONCLUSION Acupuncture appears to be equivalent to drug therapy in these patients.

20090434,"A randomized clinical trial of the efficacy of scheduled dosing of acetaminophen and hydrocodone for the management of postoperative pain in children after tonsillectomy. OBJECTIVES To determine the effectiveness of around-the-clock ( ATC ) analgesic administration, with or without nurse coaching, compared with standard care with as needed ( PRN ) dosing in children undergoing outpatient tonsillectomy. METHODS Children 6 to 15 years of age were randomized to receive acetaminophen and hydrocodone ( 167 mg/2.5 mg/5 mL ) for 3 days after surgery: Group A ( N=39 ) -every 4 hours PRN, with standard postoperative instructions ; Group B ( N=34 ) -every 4 hours ATC, with standard postoperative instructions, without nurse coaching ; and Group C ( N=40 ) -every 4 hours ATC, with standard postoperative instructions, with coaching. Parents completed a medication log, and recorded the presence and severity of opioid-related adverse effects and children 's reports of pain intensity using a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale. RESULTS No differences were found in analgesic administration or pain intensity scores between the 2 ATC groups. Therefore, they were combined for comparison with the PRN group. Children in the ATC group received more analgesic than those in the PRN group ( P < 0.0001 ). Children in the PRN group had higher pain intensity scores compared to children in the ATC group, both at rest ( P=0.017 ) and with swallowing ( P=0.017 ). Pain intensity scores for both groups were higher in the morning compared with the evening ( P < 0.0001 ). With the exception of constipation, scheduled analgesic dosing did not increase the frequency or severity of opioid-related adverse effects. DISCUSSION Scheduled dosing of acetaminophen and hydrocodone is more effective than PRN dosing in reducing pain intensity in children after tonsillectomy.

20966820,"Five-year outcome of surgical treatment of migraine headaches. BACKGROUND This study was designed to assess the long-term efficacy of surgical deactivation of migraine headache trigger sites. METHODS One hundred twenty-five volunteers were randomly assigned to the treatment ( n = 100 ) or control group ( n = 25 ) after examination by the team neurologist to ensure a diagnosis of migraine headache. Patients were asked to complete the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, Migraine-Specific Quality of Life, and Migraine Disability Assessment questionnaires before treatment and at 12- and 60-month postoperative follow-up. The treatment group received botulinum toxin to confirm the trigger sites ; controls received saline injections. Treated patients underwent surgical deactivation of trigger site ( s ). Results were analyzed at 1 year ( previously published ) and 5 years postoperatively ( the subject of this report ). RESULTS Eighty-nine of 100 patients in the treatment group underwent surgery, and 79 were followed for 5 years. Ten patients underwent deactivation of additional ( different ) trigger sites during the follow-up period and were not included in the data analysis. The final outcome with or without inclusion of these 10 patients was not statistically different. Sixty-one ( 88 percent ) of 69 patients have experienced a positive response to the surgery after 5 years. Twenty ( 29 percent ) reported complete elimination of migraine headache, 41 ( 59 percent ) noticed a significant decrease, and eight ( 12 percent ) experienced no significant change. When compared with the baseline values, all measured variables at 60 months improved significantly ( p < 0.0001 ).

9071556,"Effect of desonide ointment, 0.05 %, on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis of children with atopic dermatitis. Desonide ointment has demonstrated a good safety and efficacy profile during the many years it has been used in treating dermatoses. However, there have been no controlled clinical trials to evaluate its systemic safety when used in treating children. Suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis can occur after repeated application of topical corticosteroids. In general, the degree of suppression of the HPA axis function is related to the daily dosage of steroid given, the duration of its administration, the extent of body surface covered, and the potency of the corticosteroid. This study sought to determine the comparative effects of 0.05 percent desonide and 2.5 percent hydrocortisone ointments on the HPA axis of children with atopic dermatitis. There was no suppression of early morning cortisol in either treatment group. The ACTH-stimulated mean cortisol values after four weeks of treatment were not significantly different from the baseline values for either treatment group.

14669937,"Effect of a carbohydrate-protein supplement on endurance performance during exercise of varying intensity. Increasing the plasma glucose and insulin concentrations during prolonged variable intensity exercise by supplementing with carbohydrate has been found to spare muscle glycogen and increase aerobic endurance. Furthermore, the addition of protein to a carbohydrate supplement will enhance the insulin response of a carbohydrate supplement. The purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of a carbohydrate and a carbohydrate-protein supplement on aerobic endurance performance. Nine trained cyclists exercised on 3 separate occasions at intensities that varied between 45 % and 75 % VO2max for 3 h and then at 85 % VO2max until fatigued. Supplements ( 200 ml ) were provided every 20 min and consisted of placebo, a 7.75 % carbohydrate solution, and a 7.75 % carbohydrate/1.94 % protein solution. Treatments were administered using a double-blind randomized design. Carbohydrate supplementation significantly increased time to exhaustion ( carbohydrate 19.7 +/- 4.6 min vs. placebo 12.7 +/- 3.1 min ), while the addition of protein enhanced the effect of the carbohydrate supplement ( carbohydrate-protein 26.9 +/- 4.5 min, p <.05 ). Blood glucose and plasma insulin levels were elevated above placebo during carbohydrate and carbohydrate-protein supplementation, but no differences were found between the carbohydrate and carbohydrate-protein treatments.

17519714,"Ropivacaine versus lidocaine in digital nerve blocks: a prospective study. BACKGROUND Ropivacaine is a relatively new long-acting amide local anesthetic. Since its introduction in 1996, it has been used for subcutaneous infiltration ; epidural, intrathecal, and peripheral nerve block surgery ; and postoperative analgesia. However, it has never been used for digital blocks. This prospective, randomized, double-blind study compares the digital block results following the administration of 2.5 ml of 0.75 % ropivacaine solution and 2.5 ml of 2 % lidocaine solution. METHODS From March of 1999 to March of 2001, 70 adult patients who underwent immediate reconstruction for traumatic injuries of the digits were prospectively randomized into two groups. Group A ( n = 35 ) received 2.5 ml 0.75 % ropivacaine and group B ( n = 35 ) received 2.5 ml of 2 % lidocaine for digital anesthesia. Onset time of anesthetic action, duration of anesthesia, time until first postoperative requirement for pain medication, and digital-brachial artery systolic blood pressure index were recorded and evaluated. Local vascular effects were observed visually. RESULTS No side effects were observed. Lidocaine had the quickest onset of anesthesia, with a mean time of 1.3 minutes ( range, 1 to 2.7 minutes ). Ropivacaine had a mean onset time of 4.5 minutes ( range, 3.5 to 5.5 minutes ). The mean duration of postoperative anesthesia for lidocaine was 2.4 hours ( range, 1.4 to 4 hours ), compared with 21.5 hours for ropivacaine and less requirement for analgesics during the first 24 postoperative hours ( p < 0.05 ) ( range, 19 to 23 hours ). No significant difference was found between the digital-brachial artery systolic blood pressure index of group A compared with group B. CONCLUSIONS Ropivacaine can be used effectively as a local anesthetic for digital nerve blocks. It can be used for prolonged operations ( > 1.5 hours ) without additional injections and can provide long-lasting postoperative analgesia.","['digital nerve blocks :', 'From March of 1999 to March of 2001 , 70 adult patients who underwent immediate reconstruction for traumatic injuries of the digits', 'digital nerve blocks .']",70 adult patients who underwent immediate reconstruction for traumatic injuries of the digits,C,"['Ropivacaine', 'lidocaine', 'Ropivacaine', '2.5 ml of 0.75 % ropivacaine solution and 2.5 ml of 2 % lidocaine solution .', 'reconstruction for traumatic injuries of the digits', 'ropivacaine', 'lidocaine', 'Lidocaine', 'Ropivacaine', 'lidocaine', 'ropivacaine', 'Ropivacaine']",Group A (n = 35) received 2.5 ml 0.75% ropivacaine and group B (n = 35) received 2.5 ml of 2% lidocaine for digital anesthesia,C,"['Onset time of anesthetic action , duration of anesthesia , time until first postoperative requirement for pain medication , and digital-brachial artery systolic blood pressure index', 'Local vascular effects', 'side effects', 'onset of anesthesia', 'mean onset time', 'mean duration of postoperative anesthesia', 'digital-brachial artery systolic blood pressure index', 'effectively']","Onset time of anesthetic action, duration of anesthesia, time until first postoperative requirement for pain medication, and digital-brachial artery systolic blood pressure index",P,,1.1167470964180197,1.0,0.48148148148148145,0.65,56.25,0.2976544756345326,0.5769230769230769,0.4545454545454545,0.5084745762711863,58.333333333333336,1.1167470964180195,1.0,0.5,0.6666666666666666,75.0

OBJECTIVE We performed a randomized, prospective trial to assess the impact of fibrin glue on the incidence of lymphocysts after systematic pelvic or pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy in patients with gynecologic malignancies. METHODS Ninety-three consecutive patients with gynecologic pelvic malignancies who underwent surgery including pelvic or pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy were randomized during surgery to be treated with fibrin glue or not. Serial computed tomography ( CT ) scans were performed during follow-up. CT findings of a smooth and thin-walled cavity filled with a water-equivalent fluid, sharply demarcated from its surroundings and without signs of infiltration were interpreted as lymphocysts. RESULTS Forty-seven patients ( 51 % ) were treated with fibrin glue and 46 ( 49 % ) were not. All 93 patients underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy ; 15 patients ( 32 % ) of the fibrin group and 12 ( 26 % ) of the controls also underwent paraaortic lymphadenectomy. We found no significant differences between patients who received fibrin glue and those who did not.

Amyloid beta ( Abeta ) may play a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. A functional gamma-secretase inhibitor, LY450139, was developed that inhibits Abeta formation in whole cell assays, transgenic mice, and beagle dogs. The authors wished to determine the safety and tolerability of this drug, and the reduction of Abeta in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) after multiple doses. Volunteer subjects ( N = 37 ) were studied using doses from 5 to 50 mg/day given for 14 days. Plasma and CSF concentrations of LY450139, Abeta ( 1-40 ) and Abeta ( 1-X ) ( "" Abeta ( total ) "" ) were determined, and safety and tolerability were assessed. The plasma half-life of LY450139 was approximately 2.5 hours. Pharmacokinetic analyses showed a linear relationship between dose and plasma concentrations, with a Cmax of 828 +/- 19.2 ng/mL after a 50-mg dose. Plasma Abeta concentrations decreased in a dose-dependent manner over a 6-hour interval following drug administration, with a maximum decrease of approximately 40 % relative to baseline. After returning to baseline, Abeta concentrations were transiently increased. CSF Abeta concentrations were unchanged. Adverse events reported by subjects taking 5-mg, 20-mg, or 40-mg doses were similar to those reported by subjects taking placebo. Two of 7 subjects taking 50 mg/day experienced adverse events that may have been drug related. In this phase 1 volunteer study, reported adverse events after taking LY450139 were manageable.

METHODS Full-term newborns and children ( n = 488 ) through 8 yr of age who required general anesthesia and tracheal intubation were assigned randomly to receive either a cuffed tube sized by a new formula [ size ( mm internal diameter ) = ( age/4 ) + 3 ], or an uncuffed tube sized by the modified Cole 's formula [ size ( mm internal diameter ) = ( age/4 ) + 4 ]. The number of intubations required to achieve an appropriately sized tube, the need to use more than 21.min-1 fresh gas flow, the concentration of nitrous oxide in the operating room, and the incidence of croup were compared. RESULTS Cuffed tubes selected by our formula were appropriate for 99 % of patients. Uncuffed tubes selected by Cole 's formula were appropriate for 77 % of patients ( P < 0.001 ). The lungs of patients with cuffed tubes were adequately ventilated with 2 1.min-1 fresh gas flow, whereas 11 % of those with uncuffed tubes needed greater fresh gas flow ( P < 0.001 ). Ambient nitrous oxide concentration exceeded 25 parts per million in 37 % of cases with uncuffed tubes and in 0 % of cases with cuffed tubes ( P < 0.001 ). Three patients in each group were treated for croup symptoms ( 1.2 % cuffed ; 1.3 % uncuffed ). CONCLUSIONS Our formula for cuffed tube selection is appropriate for young children. Advantages of cuffed endotracheal tubes include avoidance of repeated laryngoscopy, use of low fresh gas flow, and reduction of the concentration of anesthetics detectable in the operating room. We conclude that cuffed endotracheal tubes may be used routinely during controlled ventilation in full-term newborns and children during anesthesia.","['young children during general anesthesia .', 'young children .', 'patients', 'Full-term newborns and children ( n = 488 ) through 8 yr of age who required general anesthesia and tracheal intubation', 'young children .', 'full-term newborns and children during anesthesia .']",Full-term newborns and children (n = 488) through 8 yr of age who required general anesthesia and tracheal intubation,C,"['cuffed and uncuffed endotracheal tubes', 'Uncuffed endotracheal tubes', 'cuffed versus uncuffed endotracheal tubes', 'cuffed tube sized by a new formula', ""uncuffed tube sized by the modified Cole 's formula"", 'Cuffed tubes', 'Uncuffed tubes', 'cuffed endotracheal tubes', 'cuffed endotracheal tubes']","Assigned randomly to receive either a cuffed tube sized by a new formula [size (mm internal diameter) = (age/4) + 3], or an uncuffed tube sized by the modified Cole's formula [size (mm internal diameter) = (age/4) + 4]",C,"['number of intubations required to achieve an appropriately sized tube', 'need to use more than 21.min-1 fresh gas flow', 'concentration of nitrous oxide in the operating room', 'incidence of croup', 'appropriate', 'appropriate', 'lungs of patients', 'adequately ventilated', 'Ambient nitrous oxide concentration', 'croup symptoms', 'appropriate', 'young children .

18270751,"The effects of candesartan on diabetes glomerulopathy: a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Our objective was to study the effects of candesartan on diabetic glomerulopathy in young normoalbuminuric and normotensive patients with type 1 diabetes in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. In 13 patients aged 24 years at baseline, we evaluated blood pressure, kidney biopsies and kidney function tests at baseline and after 5 years of treatment. Kidney biopsies were examined with light and electron microscopy, glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow determined with inulin and para-aminohippuric acid clearances. Two patients in the placebo group needed antihypertensive treatment because they developed microalbuminuria and/or hypertension, but no patient in the candesartan group did. A significant reduction in mesangial matrix volume and mesangial volume occurred in the candesartan group, although changes in morphological parameters were similar between groups. Office blood pressure was significantly lower in the candesartan group at follow-up than in the placebo group. Deterioration in morphological parameters observed in earlier studies of our patients did not become worse during treatment with candesartan or placebo. The effects of candesartan, with reduction in morphological parameters and lowering of blood pressure, might influence future treatment of glomerulopathy in type 1 diabetes patients.","['young normoalbuminuric and normotensive patients with type 1 diabetes', '13 patients aged 24 years at baseline', 'type 1 diabetes patients .']","13 patients aged 24 years at baseline with type 1 diabetes, young normoalbuminuric and normotensive",C,"['candesartan', 'placebo-controlled', 'candesartan', 'placebo-controlled', 'placebo', 'candesartan', 'candesartan', 'placebo', 'candesartan', 'placebo .', 'candesartan']",candesartan treatment for 5 years,P,"['diabetes glomerulopathy :', 'diabetic glomerulopathy', 'microalbuminuria and/or hypertension', 'mesangial matrix volume and mesangial volume', 'morphological parameters', 'Office blood pressure', 'morphological parameters', 'morphological parameters and lowering of blood pressure']","reduction in mesangial matrix volume and mesangial volume, lower office blood pressure in the candesartan group at follow-up, no worsening of morphological parameters during treatment with candesartan or placebo",P,,0.7591193654891766,0.6666666666666666,0.5,0.5714285714285715,100.0,0.0898100418739418,0.2,0.0769230769230769,0.1111111111111111,33.33333333333333,0.2707717863464931,0.3666666666666666,0.3928571428571428,0.3793103448275862,50.0
17479312,"Use of the electrothermal bipolar vessel system ( EBVS ) in laparoscopic adrenalectomy: a prospective study. BACKGROUND Since laparoscopic adrenalectomy ( LA ) has been adopted as the gold standard for the treatment of adrenal diseases, the development of technology for vascular control and dissection manoeuvres, amongst other things, may play a pivotal role in its further improvement. We report our experience with the electrothermal bipolar vessel sealing ( EBVS ) device for LA. METHODS From January 2004 to January 2006, 50 patients ( pts ) undergoing LA were selected and randomized for use of the EBVS ( 25 pts, group A ) versus the UltraSonic Shears ( USS ) device ( 25 pts, group B ). Age, sex, body mass index ( BMI ), previous surgery and associated diseases were similar between the two groups. The main surgical parameters collected for each patient ( pt ) concerned operative time, major and minor complications, conversion rate, blood loss, hospital stay and histology. RESULTS There was no mortality in either group. The right adrenalectomy mean operative time ( OpT ) was 51.8 mins ( range 40-90 mins ) and 68.6 mins ( range 50-130 mins ) in group A and B, respectively ( P not significant ). The left adrenalectomy mean OpT was 72.2 mins ( range 55-100 mins ) and 94 mins ( range 65-140 mins ) for group A and B, respectively ( P < 0.05 ). The mean blood loss was 83 ml ( group A ) and 210 ml ( group B ) ( p < 0.05 ). Complications were not different for the two groups. The mean hospital stay was 2.9 and 3.1 days in group A and B, respectively ( P not significant ).

The past 20 years have seen an overall decline in survey response rates and an even more pronounced decline in samples of health care professionals. The authors tested the use of a "" thank you "" or "" reminder "" postcard as a method by which to stem the tide of declining response rates. The authors conducted a mail and telephone survey of 49,605 registered nurses for the 2000 National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses and sent an extra mailing to a random subsample ( n = 4,968 ). They then compared response rates for both groups. Contrary to prior research, this study found that reminder postcards did not improve response rates or rates of return. There may be several reasons for this finding, including the general familiarity with, and high saliency of, this research project for the nursing community.

19330795,"The SNRI venlafaxine improves emotional unawareness in patients with post-stroke depression. OBJECTIVE Patients with stroke have a high prevalence of depression and unawareness of emotions or alexithymia. Here we investigated the effects of the serotoninergic and noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor ( SNRI ) venlafaxine in comparison with the SSRI fluoxetine on alexithymia severity in patients with DSM-IV post-stroke major depressive-like episode ( PSD ). METHODS Fifty inpatients with first-ever stroke and PSD were consecutively enrolled in this randomized open-label study. Twenty-five were treated with the SNRI venlafaxine SR ( 75-150 mg/die ), and 25 with the SSRI fluoxetine ( 20-40 mg/die ). All patients were assessed at day 0, and after 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks, using the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale ( TAS-20 ). RESULTS Patients treated with fluoxetine and those treated with venlafaxine showed similar improvement in depressive symptoms. However, patients treated with venlafaxine had a greater improvement on alexithymia severity than those treated with fluoxetine. The effect of venlafaxine on unawareness of emotions was evident in patients with alexithymia ( TAS-20 > or= 61 ) at the baseline and in those without alexithymia ( TAS-20 < 61 ).

22079088,"Safety and efficacy of sitaxsentan 50 and 100 mg in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. OBJECTIVE To assess safety and efficacy of sitaxsentan 50 and 100 mg in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ). BACKGROUND Sitaxsentan is a highly selective endothelin-A receptor antagonist that was recently withdrawn by the manufacturer because of a pattern of idiosyncratic liver injury. METHODS Before sitaxsentan withdrawal, this 18-week double-blind, placebo-controlled study randomized patients with PAH to receive placebo or sitaxsentan 50 or 100 mg once daily. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in 6-min walk distance ( 6MWD ) at week 18. Changes in World Health Organization ( WHO ) functional class and time to clinical worsening ( TTCW ) were secondary endpoints. The primary efficacy analysis was powered for sitaxsentan 100 mg versus placebo. RESULTS Of 98 randomized patients, 61 % were WHO functional class II at baseline. Improvement from baseline to week 18 in 6MWD occurred with sitaxsentan 100 but not 50 mg ; a strong placebo effect was observed. At week 18, WHO functional class was improved or maintained in more patients receiving sitaxsentan 100 mg than placebo ( P = 0.038 ) ; 0 % versus 12 % of patients deteriorated, respectively. TTCW was not significantly different for 100-mg sitaxsentan patients than placebo ( P = 0.090 ). Adverse events ( AEs ) occurring more frequently with sitaxsentan ( 50 or 100 mg ) included headache, peripheral edema, dizziness, nausea, extremity pain, and fatigue ; most AEs were of mild or moderate severity. CONCLUSION Sitaxsentan 100 mg improved functional class but not 6MWD in PAH patients who were mostly WHO functional class II at baseline.

24061784,"Baseline factors predicting placebo response to treatment in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders: a multisite randomized clinical trial. IMPORTANCE The finding of factors that differentially predict the likelihood of response to placebo over that of an active drug could have a significant impact on study design in this population. OBJECTIVE To identify possible nonspecific, baseline predictors of response to intervention in a large randomized clinical trial of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized clinical trial of citalopram hydrobromide for children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders and prominent repetitive behavior. Baseline data at study entry were examined with respect to final outcome to determine if response predictors could be identified. A total of 149 children and adolescents 5 to 17 years of age ( mean [ SD ] age, 9.4 [ 3.1 ] years ) from 6 academic centers were randomly assigned to citalopram ( n = 73 ) or placebo ( n = 76 ). Participants had autistic disorder, Asperger syndrome, or pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified ; had illness severity ratings that were moderate or more than moderate on the Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale ; and scored moderate or more than moderate on compulsive behaviors measured with the modified Children 's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale. INTERVENTIONS Twelve weeks of treatment with citalopram ( 10 mg/5 mL ) or placebo. The mean ( SD ) maximum dose of citalopram was 16.5 ( 6.5 ) mg by mouth daily ( maximum dose, 20 mg/d ). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES A positive response was defined as having a score of at least much improved on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale at week 12. Baseline measures included demographic ( sex, age, weight, and pubertal status ), clinical, and family measures. Clinical variables included baseline illness severity ratings ( the Aberrant Behavior Checklist, the Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised, and the Children 's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale ). Family measures included the Caregiver Strain Questionnaire. RESULTS Several baseline predictors of response were identified, and a principal component analysis yielded 3 composite measures ( disruptive behavior, autism/mood, and caregiver strain ) that significantly predicted response at week 12. Specifically, participants in the placebo group were significantly less likely than participants in the citalopram group to respond at week 12 if they entered the study more symptomatic on each of the 3 composite measures, and they were at least 2 times less likely to be responders.

24768960,"To excise or ablate endometriosis ? A prospective randomized double-blinded trial after 5-year follow-up. STUDY OBJECTIVE To compare reduction of pain after laparoscopy for ablation or excision of endometriosis. DESIGN Prospective, randomized, double-blind study ( Canadian Task Force classification I ). SETTING Endometriosis and pelvic pain clinic at a university teaching hospital. PATIENTS Women of reproductive age with pelvic pain and visually proved endometriosis. INTERVENTIONS Subjects completed a questionnaire rating various kinds of pain using visual analog scales ( VAS ). After visual identification subjects were randomized to treatment via ablation or excision by supervised training gynecologists as primary surgeons. Follow-up questionnaires documented pain levels every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 5 years. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Change in pain VAS scores during 5 years after the operation and rates of pregnancy, repeat surgery, and use of hormone therapy were evaluated. There was a reduction in all pain scores over the 5-year follow-up in both treatment groups. A significantly greater reduction in dyspareunia VAS scores was observed in the excision group at 5 years ( p =.03 at univariate analysis, and p =.007 at multivariate analysis ). More women in the ablation group continued to receive medical treatment of endometriosis at 5 years ( p =.004 ).

24930383,"Elevation of HDL-C in response to statin treatment is involved in the regression of carotid atherosclerosis. AIM Atherosclerosis is strongly associated with an increased mortality in subjects with diabetes. The carotid intima-media thickness ( IMT ) is commonly measured as a surrogate marker for cardiovascular risk. Statins are well-established protective agents against atherosclerosis and reportedly suppress IMT progression in subjects with diabetes. To clarify the effects of statins on subclinical atherosclerosis, we herein investigated changes in the carotid IMT and lipid profiles in a multi-center, prospective, randomized trial. METHODS Hypercholesterolemic subjects with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to open-label treatment with either pravastatin or pitavastatin. The primary endpoint of this study was the IMT change after 36 months of statin treatment. RESULTS A total of 97 subjects ( 51 pitavastatin ; 46 pravastatin ) completed this 36-month study. The LDL-C decreased significantly from 163.4 Â± 27.9 mg/dl at baseline to 100.4 Â± 19.6 mg/dl at 36 months in the pitavastatin group and from 159.7 Â± 25.6 mg/dl to 118.5 Â± 22.1 mg/dl in the pravastatin group. The mean IMT showed moderate regression in both the pitavastatin ( -0.070 Â± 0.215 mm, P < 0.05 ) and the pravastatin ( -0.067 Â± 0.260 mm ) group. However, there was no significant difference in the IMT change between the two groups. When the two groups were combined, the 36-month change in the mean IMT was significantly associated with HDL-C change ( r=-0.24, P= 0.03 ). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed the change in HDL-C to be an independent variable showing a positive correlation with the carotid IMT reduction.

21801451,"Falls and mobility in Parkinson 's disease: protocol for a randomised controlled clinical trial. BACKGROUND Although physical therapy and falls prevention education are argued to reduce falls and disability in people with idiopathic Parkinson 's disease, this has not yet been confirmed with a large scale randomised controlled clinical trial. The study will investigate the effects on falls, mobility and quality of life of ( i ) movement strategy training combined with falls prevention education, ( ii ) progressive resistance strength training combined with falls prevention education, ( iii ) a generic life-skills social program ( control group ). METHODS/DESIGN People with idiopathic Parkinson 's disease who live at home will be recruited and randomly allocated to one of three groups. Each person shall receive therapy in an out-patient setting in groups of 3-4. Each group shall be scheduled to meet once per week for 2 hours for 8 consecutive weeks. All participants will also have a structured 2 hour home practice program for each week during the 8 week intervention phase. Assessments will occur before therapy, after the 8 week therapy program, and at 3 and 12 months after the intervention. A falls calendar will be kept by each participant for 12 months after outpatient therapy.Consistent with the recommendations of the Prevention of Falls Network Europe group, three falls variables will be used as the primary outcome measures: the number of fallers, the number of multiple fallers and the falls rate. In addition to quantifying falls, we shall measure mobility, activity limitations and quality of life as secondary outcomes. DISCUSSION This study has the potential to determine whether outpatient movement strategy training combined with falls prevention education or progressive resistance strength training combined with falls prevention education are effective for reducing falls and improving mobility and life quality in people with Parkinson 's disease who live at home.

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS Macrovascular disease is an important cause of the increased morbidity and mortality rates associated with type 1 diabetes, and this vascular impairment begins in childhood. The aim of this study was to determine whether introducing intensive diabetes management [ intensive insulin therapy ( IIT ) and 'Sweet Talk ' text-messaging support ] produces measurable improvements in endothelial function. METHODS One hundred and twenty-six patients fulfilled the eligibility criteria ( type 1 diabetes for > 1 year ; on conventional insulin therapy ( CIT ) ; aged between 8 and 18 years ), of whom 92 enrolled. Patients were randomised to group 1, CIT only ( n=28 ) ; group 2, CIT and Sweet Talk ( n=33 ) ; or group 3, IIT and Sweet Talk ( n=31 ). Vascular assessments ( including measures of endothelial damage, activation, dysfunction and oxidative stress ) and HbA1c were performed at baseline and repeated after 12 months of the study. RESULTS Glycaemic control deteriorated in patients on CIT, but improved significantly in patients allocated to IIT ( p=0.007 ). IIT was associated with significantly greater improvements in E-selectin ( p < 0.0001 ) than CIT ( group 1, p=0.026 and group 2, p=0.053 ). Vascular responses to acetylcholine improved in patients on IIT ( p=0.017 ), but not in patients receiving CIT. These changes were all independent of HbA1c level. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION IIT appears to be associated with improvements in vascular markers, independently of changes in HbA1c, suggesting that IIT may confer vascular protection in addition to improving glycaemic control.","['young people with type 1 diabetes .', 'One hundred and twenty-six patients fulfilled the eligibility criteria ( type 1 diabetes for > 1 year ; on conventional insulin therapy ( CIT ) ; aged between 8 and 18 years ) , of whom 92 enrolled .']","126 patients with type 1 diabetes for > 1 year, on conventional insulin therapy (CIT), aged between 8 and 18 years",P,"['Intensive insulin therapy', 'intensive diabetes management [ intensive', ""'Sweet Talk ' text-messaging support ]"", 'conventional insulin therapy ( CIT ) ;', 'CIT only ( n=28 ) ; group 2 , CIT and Sweet Talk ( n=33 ) ; or group 3 , IIT and Sweet Talk ( n=31 ) .

OBJECTIVE To investigate the influence of xenogenic ( porcine ) acellular dermal matrix on the systematic inflammatory reaction syndrome ( SIRS ), and the reaction of burn patients to tissue damage upon application to second-degree burn wounds. METHOD Seventy-two cases of patients with acute second-degree burns were enrolled in the study. According to the total burn surface area ( TBSA ) and the treatment methods, we randomly divided the patients into four groups. Group A ( treatment group ): patients with less than 30 % TBSA covered with xenogenic acellular dermal matrix. Group B ( control group ): patients with less than 30 % TBSA covered with betadine ointment gauzes. Group C ( treatment group ): patients with more than 30 % TBSA covered with porcine acellular dermal matrix. Group D ( control group ): patients with more than 30 % TBSA covered with betadine ointment gauzes. Serum level of C-reactive protein ( CRP ) was measured by single radial immunodiffusion method on 1, 4, 7 and 14 days postburn. RESULTS The serum level of CRP in group A was significantly less than that of in group B ( P < 0.05 ) on days 4, 7 and 14. The serum level of CRP in group C increased slowly, descended quickly and was significantly less than that of in group D on days 4, 7 and 14.

Hypertension after treatment with vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) receptor inhibitors is associated with superior treatment outcomes for advanced cancer patients. To determine whether increased sorafenib doses cause incremental increases in blood pressure ( BP ), we measured 12-h ambulatory BP in 41 normotensive advanced solid tumor patients in a randomized dose-escalation study. After 7 days ' treatment ( 400 mg b.i.d. ), mean diastolic BP ( DBP ) increased in both study groups. After dose escalation, group A ( 400 mg t.i.d. ) had marginally significant further increase in 12-h mean DBP ( P = 0.053 ), but group B ( 600 mg b.i.d. ) did not achieve statistically significant increases ( P = 0.25 ). Within groups, individuals varied in BP response to sorafenib dose escalation, but these differences did not correlate with changes in steady-state plasma sorafenib concentrations.

23061531,"The effect of prethrombolytic cyclosporine-A injection on clinical outcome of acute anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction. INTRODUCTION Reperfusion injury reduces the benefits of early reperfusion therapies after acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ). Cyclosporine-A ( CsA ) is a potent inhibitor of opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, which has been shown to play a key role in myocardial reperfusion injury. The impact of this treatment on clinical outcomes of acute STEMI remains unknown. Our aim was to investigate the clinical outcomes of using this drug in patients with acute anterior STEMI receiving thrombolytic treatment ( TLT ). METHODS In this double-blinded randomized clinical trial, 101 patients with acute anterior STEMI who were candidate for TLT, were enrolled and randomly assigned into treatment or control groups. Patients in the treatment group received an intravenous bolus injection of 2.5 mg/kg of CsA immediately before TLT. The patients in the control group received an equivalent volume of normal saline. Infarct size, occurrence of major arrhythmias, heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ), TLT-related complications, in-hospital and 6-month mortality rates were investigated. RESULTS There were no significant differences among the demographics, myocardial enzyme release, occurrence of major arrhythmias [ 9 ( 18 % ) vs. 12 ( 23.5 % ), P = 0.80 ], heart failure [ 18 ( 36 % ) vs. 19 ( 38.3 % ), P = 0.83 ], LVEF at first day [ 34.7 Â± 9.9 % vs. 33.5 Â± 8.1 %, P = 0.50 ] or at discharge [ 37.7 Â± 10 % vs. 36.1 Â± 8.2 %, P = 0.43 ], and in-hospital [ 4 ( 8 % ) vs. 6 ( 11.8 % ), P = 0.74 ] or 6-month mortality rates [ 9 ( 18 % ) vs. 10 ( 19.6 % ), P = 0.99 ] between the CsA vs. the control group.

Five experiments tested the idea that instructing a witness to close their eyes during retrieval might increase retrieval success. In Experiment 1 participants watched a video, before a cued-recall test for which they were either instructed to close their eyes, or received no-instructions. Eye-closure led to an increase in correct cued-recall, with no increase in incorrect responses. Experiments 2-5 sought to test the generality of this effect over variations in study material ( video or live interaction ), test format ( cued- or free-recall ) and information modality ( visual or auditory details recalled ). Overall, eye-closure increased recall of both visual detail and auditory details, with no accompanying increase in recall of false details.

12093460,"A pilot study of the safety and efficacy of supplemental arginine to enhance immune function in persons with HIV/AIDS. OBJECTIVE We collected preliminary data on the safety and efficacy of supplemental arginine to improve natural killer cell cytotoxicity in a sample of persons with human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ). METHODS In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study in an academic medical center-based infectious disease clinic, 11 clinically stable, HIV-infected adults had been treated with highly active, antiretroviral therapy and had HIV plasma RNA levels of less than 10 000 copies/mL. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 19.6 g of arginine/d ( n = 6 ) or placebo ( n = 5 ) for 14 d. Plasma HIV RNA levels, neuropsychologic functioning, and self-reported adverse events were analyzed for safety of treatment. Efficacy was measured by natural killer cell cytotoxicity. RESULTS None of the participants experienced any adverse clinical, virologic, or neuropsychologic events that necessitated withdrawal from the study. The arginine-supplemented group showed a mean natural killer cell cytotoxicity increase of 18.9 lytic units, whereas the placebo group showed an increase of 0.3 lytic units. This difference was not statistically significant ( P = 0.79 ). CONCLUSIONS Short-term arginine supplementation is safe for persons with HIV/AIDS.

7564450,"Hemostatic function of aspirin-treated platelets vulnerable to cardiopulmonary bypass. Altered shear-induced pathway. The impaired hemostasis of aspirin-treated patients is an annoying problem during and after cardiopulmonary bypass. The hemostatic function of platelets comprises two mechanisms: the shear-induced and the cyclooxygenase pathways. Because the latter is inhibited in aspirin-treated patients, the hemostatic function depends mainly on the former pathway. To investigate the effect of cardiopulmonary bypass on the shear-induced pathway, a double-blind study of preoperative aspirin treatment ( 325 mg ) and placebo was conducted in 40 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Postoperative blood loss was higher in the aspirin-treated patients than in the placebo-treated patients ( p < 0.05 ). The shear-induced hemostasis was monitored by the in vitro bleeding test ( Thrombostat ), which mimics bleeding through an injured arteriole. The shear-induced pathway of aspirin-treated platelets was not affected before cardiopulmonary bypass, but it was impaired more during the operation ( p < 0.01 ) and remained worse afterward ( p < 0.05 ), compared with that of placebo-treated platelets. The inhibitory effects of aspirin on thromboxane production and on collagen-induced platelet aggregation remained throughout the operation. In aspirin-treated platelets, the aggregation capacity induced by adenosine diphosphate was inhibited before the operation ( p < 0.05 ) and showed substantial recovery during the operation ( p < 0.05 ). These results suggest that the shear-induced pathway of aspirin-treated platelets is more vulnerable to cardiopulmonary bypass than the pathway in normal platelets and causes severe impairment of hemostasis afterward.","['aspirin-treated patients', 'during and after cardiopulmonary bypass .', 'aspirin-treated patients', '40 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting .', 'aspirin-treated patients']",40 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting,C,"['aspirin-treated', 'aspirin-treated', 'aspirin-treated', 'aspirin', 'placebo', 'coronary artery bypass grafting .', 'aspirin-treated', 'aspirin-treated', 'placebo-treated', 'aspirin', 'aspirin-treated', 'aspirin-treated']",preoperative aspirin treatment (325 mg) and placebo,C,"['Hemostatic function', 'hemostatic function', 'Postoperative blood loss', 'shear-induced hemostasis', 'shear-induced pathway of aspirin-treated platelets', 'thromboxane production and on collagen-induced platelet aggregation', 'aggregation capacity']","Postoperative blood loss, shear-induced hemostasis, thromboxane production, collagen-induced platelet aggregation, aggregation capacity induced by adenosine diphosphate",P,,1.1167470964180197,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.5,70.0,0.0926611543143843,0.2857142857142857,0.0869565217391304,0.1333333333333333,28.57142857142857,0.2504216192050242,0.7777777777777778,0.5185185185185185,0.6222222222222222,66.66666666666666
15131557,"Primary stenting of occluded native coronary arteries: final results of the Primary Stenting of Occluded Native Coronary Arteries ( PRISON ) study. BACKGROUND Primary intracoronary stent placement after successfully crossing chronic total coronary occlusions may decrease the high restenosis rate at long-term follow-up compared with conventional balloon angioplasty. METHODS In a prospective, randomized trial, balloon angioplasty was compared with stent implantation for the treatment of chronic total occlusions. Patients were followed for 12 months with angiographic follow-up at 6 months. Quantitative coronary analysis was performed by an independent core lab. RESULTS A total of 200 patients were enrolled. Baseline characteristics were evenly distributed. After the procedure the mean minimal luminal diameter in the conventional group was 2.34 +/- 0.46 mm versus 2.90 +/- 0.41 mm in the stented group ( P <.0001 ). The 6-month angiographic follow-up showed a mean minimal luminal diameter of 1.57 +/- 0.74 mm in the conventional group versus 1.93 +/- 0.85 mm in the stented group ( P =.009 ) and a mean diameter stenosis of 44.7 % +/- 25.0 % versus 35.5 % +/- 26.5 % ( P =.036 ). Binary angiographic restenosis ( > 50 % diameter stenosis ) was seen in 33 % in the conventional group versus 22 % in the stented group ( P =.137 ). The reocclusion rates were 7.3 % and 8.2 %, respectively ( P = 1.00 ). At 12 month follow-up, the rate of target lesion revascularization was significantly higher in the conventional group ( 29 % versus 13 %, P <.0001 ).

9512152,"Primary glaucoma triple procedure in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma: the effect of mitomycin C in patients with and without prognostic factors for filtration failure. PURPOSE To investigate the effect of adjunctive mitomycin C on primary glaucoma triple procedure in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma with and without one or more of the prognostic factors for filtration failure of primary glaucoma triple procedure. Those factors include being of African-American race, having a preoperative intraocular pressure of 20 mm Hg or more on maximum tolerated medications, and being on two or more medications preoperatively. METHODS Study patients consisted of 197 consecutive patients with primary open-angle glaucoma who were randomly assigned to receive either no adjunctive mitomycin C ( 101 eyes of 101 patients ) or to receive adjunctive subconjunctival mitomycin C ( 96 eyes of 96 patients ) during the primary glaucoma triple procedure. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis comparisons were made between respective subgroups with and without prognostic indicators for filtration failures using a relatively stringent set of criteria for filtration success of primary glaucoma triple procedure. RESULTS There was no statistically significant ( P =.117 ) difference in filtration success of primary glaucoma triple procedure between the control and mitomycin C groups. Adjunctive mitomycin C significantly ( P <.05 ) improved the filtration outcome of the primary glaucoma triple procedure in the subgroups with each of the three prognostic factors for filtration failure of primary glaucoma triple procedure. On the other hand, in the subgroups without the prognostic factors, adjunctive mitomycin C did not significantly ( P >.05 ) change the filtration outcome of the primary glaucoma triple procedure.

AIMS The purpose of this paper is to examine the measurement of adherence to medication taking in hypertensive patients. Adherence was evaluated primarily by means of MEMS ( Medication Event Monitoring System, Aprex Corporation, Fremont, California ) an electronic system that records the date and time of opening of the study medication container. Additional measurements such as change in urinary potassium level, capsule count, client self report and physician estimate of adherence were recorded. METHODS A randomised clinical trial was used to assign patients to receive the study medication ( potassium ) or placebo. Descriptive statistics were used to answer the research questions. Frequency and percentage of responses to different measures of adherence were carried out as well as correlation between the measures. RESULTS One hundred and seven subjects between the ages of 26 and 80 participated in the clinical trial. The results showed that adherence measures varied with lowest adherence from two items of self-report related to forgetfulness ( 46 and 55 % ) and stringent electronic monitoring with the MEMS ( 58 % ) to percentages in the 80-90 range for other self-report items and the general adherence scale.

Of 200 evaluable patients, 51 were treated intramuscularly ( IM ) with 3 x 10 ( 6 ) U ( 3 MU ) /m2 daily for 3 weeks ( total dose 63 MU/m2 ), 50 received subcutaneous thrice-weekly injections of 3 MU/m2 for 4 weeks ( total dose 36 MU/m2 ), 51 underwent diathermocoagulation, and 48 were not treated and were used as a control group. Six months after the end of treatment, the overall response rate ( complete and partial responses ) was 70 %: 57 and 82 % for patients receiving interferon alpha-2b ( IM and subcutaneously ) and diathermocoagulation, respectively, and 8 % for the control group. After 6 months from therapy, no significant differences in complete response were found among the different types of treatment: 20, 20, and 35 % for the two interferon groups and the diathermocoagulation group, respectively. Fifteen and two complete responders in the cauterization and interferon groups, respectively, experienced disease recurrence ( P less than.01 ). All patients given interferon therapy complained of flu-like symptoms, which declined progressively after the first week of treatment. Fatigue, lasting as long as patients received interferon, was the most prevalent chronic side effect. We conclude that systemic recombinant interferon alpha-2b is active in treating patients with primary condyloma lesions and does so as well as cauterization.","['primary multiple and widespread anogenital condyloma .

12424783,"Effects of two types of social support and education on adaptation to early-stage breast cancer. A Roy adaptation model-based support and education intervention for women with early-stage breast cancer was tested in a three-group, three-phase randomized clinical trial of a sample of 125 women. The experimental group received 13 months of combined individual telephone and in-person group support and education, Control Group 1 received 13 months of telephone-only individual support and education, and Control Group 2 received one-time mailed educational information. The experimental group and Control Group 1 reported less mood disturbance at the end of all three phases, less loneliness at the end of Phases II and III, and a higher-quality relationship with a significant other at the end of Phase II than did Control Group 2. No group differences were found for cancer-related worry or well-being. The findings suggest that individual telephone support may provide an effective alternative to in-person support groups.

23690414,"Methylphenidate and/or a nursing telephone intervention for fatigue in patients with advanced cancer: a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II trial. PURPOSE Cancer-related-fatigue ( CRF ) is common in advanced cancer. The primary objective of the study was to compare the effects of methylphenidate ( MP ) with those of placebo ( PL ) on CRF as measured using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue ( FACIT-F ) fatigue subscale. The effect of a combined intervention including MP plus a nursing telephone intervention ( NTI ) was also assessed. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with advanced cancer with a fatigue score of â‰¥ 4 out of 10 on the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale ( ESAS ) were randomly assigned to one of the following four groups: MP+NTI, PL+NTI, MP + control telephone intervention ( CTI ), and PL+CTI. Methylphenidate dose was 5 mg every 2 hours as needed up to 20 mg per day. The primary end point was the median difference in FACIT-F fatigue at day 15. Secondary outcomes included anxiety, depression, and sleep. RESULTS One hundred forty-one patients were evaluable. Median FACIT-F fatigue scores improved from baseline to day 15 in all groups: MP+NTI ( median score, 4.5 ; P =.005 ), PL+NTI ( median score, 8.0 ; P <.001 ), MP+CTI ( median score, 7.0 ; P =.004 ), and PL+CTI ( median score, 5.0 ; P =.03 ). However, there were no significant differences in the median improvement in FACIT-F fatigue between the MP and PL groups ( 5.5 v 6.0, respectively ; P =.69 ) and among all four groups ( P =.16 ). Fatigue ( P <.001 ), nausea ( P =.01 ), depression ( P =.02 ), anxiety ( P =.01 ), drowsiness ( P <.001 ), appetite ( P =.009 ), sleep ( P <.001 ), and feeling of well-being ( P <.001 ), as measured by the ESAS, significantly improved in patients who received NTI.

20048611,"Evaluation of a new wound closure device for linear surgical incisions: 3M Steri-Strip S Surgical Skin Closure versus subcuticular closure. BACKGROUND Technological innovations are often adopted before scientific comparison to an accepted standard. The authors ' study compared suture with a new coaptive film device, 3M Steri-Strip S Surgical Skin Closure, on linear incisions. METHODS Patients undergoing Wise-pattern breast reduction or abdominal procedures had paired incisions randomly assigned to Steri-Strip S or suture closure. Key outcome measures were closure time, patient comfort, and scar quality at 6 months by patients and surgeons using a new scar evaluation tool, visual assessment of linear scars. Statistical differences between the two closure techniques were assessed by Wilcoxon signed rank test. RESULTS Of 59 patients, eight were excluded from randomization ( a surgeon judged Steri-Strip S to be a nonviable closure technique for mismatched wound edges ). Fifty-one patients ( breast, n = 24 ; abdomen, n = 27 ) were randomized. Operative time with Steri-Strip S for breast was 2.0 minutes ( SD = 1.1 ) versus suture closure at 4.6 minutes ( SD = 1.5 ; p < 0.001 ). Similarly, Steri-Strip S versus suture for the abdomen was faster ( p < 0.001 ; 4.9 minutes, SD = 2.3 versus 10.1 minutes, SD = 3.4 ). Comfort scores did not differ between closures [ 5.8 ( SD = 2.7 ) versus 6.9 ( SD = 2.0 ), respectively, on breast ( p = 0.142 ) and 7.7 ( SD = 1.8 ) versus 7.7 ( SD = 2.3 ) on abdomen ( p = 0.903 ) ]. Complication rates did not differ between closure types. Patients ' visual assessment of linear scars rating of breasts was 3.8 ( SD = 2.9 ) for Steri-Strip S and better at 2.6 ( SD = 2.9 ) for suture ( p = 0.008 ). One surgeon rated breast Steri-Strip S scars worse than suture scars ( 4.3 versus 3.7 ; p = 0.014 ). For abdominal scars, there was no difference in the patient or surgeon ratings. CONCLUSIONS Steri-Strip S permits faster wound closure than suture. On the basis of patient reports of comfort and scar quality, surgeons increase efficiency and maintain quality with the use of Steri-Strip S on abdominal wounds but not on breast wounds.","['linear surgical incisions :', 'Patients undergoing Wise-pattern breast reduction or abdominal procedures', 'Of 59 patients , eight were excluded from randomization', 'Fifty-one patients ( breast , n = 24 ; abdomen , n = 27 )']",59 patients undergoing Wise-pattern breast reduction or abdominal procedures,P,"['3M Steri-Strip S Surgical Skin Closure versus subcuticular closure .', 'new coaptive film device , 3M Steri-Strip S Surgical Skin Closure , on linear incisions .', 'Steri-Strip S or suture closure .', 'new scar evaluation tool', 'Steri-Strip S', 'suture closure', 'Steri-Strip S', 'suture .']",Paired incisions randomly assigned to Steri-Strip S or suture closure,P,"['closure time , patient comfort , and scar quality', 'Operative time', 'faster', 'Comfort scores', 'Complication rates', ""Patients ' visual assessment of linear scars rating of breasts"", 'wound closure', 'comfort and scar quality', 'efficiency', 'quality']","Closure time, patient comfort, and scar quality at 6 months by patients and surgeons using a new scar evaluation tool, visual assessment of linear scars",P,,0.9015250342896094,0.9,0.3103448275862069,0.4615384615384615,34.61538461538461,0.4923043087033379,0.6363636363636364,0.1627906976744186,0.2592592592592593,27.77777777777778,0.4568760712373732,0.52,0.4193548387096774,0.4642857142857142,52.38095238095239

16190799,"A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of valproate for aggression in youth with pervasive developmental disorders. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to study valproate efficacy and safety for aggression in children and adolescents with pervasive developmental disorders ( PDD ). METHODS In this prospective double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 30 subjects ( 20 boys, 10 girls ) 6-20 years of age with PDD and significant aggression were randomized and received treatment with valproate ( VPA ) or placebo ( PBO ) for 8 weeks as outpatients. Mean VPA trough blood levels were 75.5 mcg/mL at week 4 and 77.8 mcg/mL at week 8. RESULTS No treatment difference was observed statistically between VPA and PBO groups. The Aberrant Behavior Checklist -- Community Scale ( ABC-C ) Irritability subscale was the primary outcome measure ( p = 0.65 ), and CGI -- Improvement ( p = 0.16 ) and OAS ( p = 0.96 ) were secondary outcome measures. Increased appetite and skin rash were significant side effects. Only 1 subject was dropped from the study owing to side effects, notably a spreading skin rash, which then resolved spontaneously. Two subjects receiving VPA developed increased serum ammonia levels, one with an associated parent report of slurred speech and mild cognitive slowing. Poststudy, of 16 VPA and PBO subjects receiving VPA, 10 subjects demonstrated sustained response, 4 of whom later attempted taper, with significant relapse of aggression. CONCLUSION The present negative findings can not be viewed as conclusive, partly owing to the large placebo response, subject heterogeneity, and size of the groups.

7699494,"A comparison of 1- and 3-minute lockout periods during patient-controlled sedation with midazolam. PURPOSE The maximum effect of midazolam injected intravenously occurs in about 3 minutes. Patient-controlled sedation carried out with 1-mg increments of midazolam at 3-minute intervals provides comparable conditions to that of doctor-controlled sedation carried out with 1-mg increments at 1-minute intervals, except for the longer duration taken for the patients to achieve satisfactory sedation prior to surgery. The purpose of this study was to find out how safe it would be to shorten the interval of increments of midazolam to 1 minute in patient-controlled sedation. PATIENTS AND METHODS In a randomized crossover study, 26 patients undergoing bilateral lower third molar surgery at two visits had patient-controlled sedation with 1 mg midazolam increments at 1-minute or 3-minute intervals at one visit and the alternative at the other visit. RESULTS The time taken for patients to achieve a degree of sedation that they thought was sufficient to tolerate the surgery was significantly longer when the increment interval was 3 minutes ( t = -4.8 ; P <.05 ). Both techniques provided good operating conditions, stable vital signs, mild to moderate sedation, without loss of verbal contact.

AIM To determine the efficacy and tolerability of PHX1149, a novel dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP4 ) inhibitor, in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS This is a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-week study in patients with type 2 diabetes with suboptimal metabolic control. Patients with a baseline haemoglobin A ( 1c ) ( HbA ( 1c ) ) of 7.3 to 11.0 % were randomized 1: 1: 1: 1 to receive once-daily oral therapy with either PHX1149 ( 100, 200 or 400 mg ) or placebo ; patients were on a constant background therapy of either metformin alone or metformin plus a glitazone. RESULTS Treatment with 100, 200 or 400 mg of PHX1149 significantly decreased postprandial glucose area under the curve AUC ( 0-2 h ) by approximately 20 % ( +0.11 +/- 0.50, -2.08 +/- 0.51, -1.73 +/- 0.49 and -1.88 +/- 0.48 mmol/l x h, respectively, for placebo and 100, 200 and 400 mg ( p = 0.002, 0.008 and 0.004 vs. placebo ). Postprandial AUC ( 0-2 h ) of intact glucagon-like peptide-1, the principal mediator of the biological effects of DPP4 inhibitors, was increased by 3.90 +/- 2.83, 11.63 +/- 2.86, 16.42 +/- 2.72 and 15.75 +/- 2.71 pmol/l x h, respectively, for placebo and 100, 200 and 400 mg ( p = 0.053, 0.001 and 0.002 vs. placebo ). Mean HbA ( 1c ) was lower in all dose groups ; the placebo-corrected change in the groups receiving 400 mg PHX1149 was -0.28 % ( p = 0.02 ). DPP4 inhibition on day 28 was 53, 73 and 78 % at 24 h postdose in the groups receiving 100, 200 and 400 mg PHX1149, respectively.

22079053,"Effect of cervical spine manipulative therapy on judo athletes ' grip strength. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to perform an investigation evaluating if cervical spinal manipulative therapy ( SMT ) can increase grip strength on judo athletes in a top 10 national-ranked team. METHODS A single-blinded, prospective, comparative, pilot, randomized, clinical trial was performed with 18 athletes of both sexes from a judo team currently competing on a national level. The athletes were randomly assigned to 2 groups: chiropractic SMT and sham. Three interventions were performed on each of the athletes at different time points. Force measurements were obtained by a hydraulic dynamometer immediately before and after each intervention at the same period before training up to 3 weeks with at least 36 hours between interventions. RESULTS Analysis of grip strength data revealed a statistically significant increase in strength within the treatment group after the first intervention ( 6.95 % right, 12.61 % left ) as compared with the second ( 11.53 % right, 17.02 % left ) and the third interventions ( 10.53 % right, 16.81 % left ). No statistically significant differences were found in grip strength comparison within the sham group. Overall differences in strength were consistently significant between the study groups ( P =.0025 ). CONCLUSION The present study suggests that the grip strength of national level judo athletes receiving chiropractic SMT improved compared to those receiving sham.","[""judo athletes '"", 'judo athletes in a top 10 national-ranked team .', '18 athletes of both sexes from a judo team currently competing on a national level .', 'national level judo athletes']",18 athletes of both sexes from a judo team currently competing on a national level,C,"['cervical spine manipulative therapy', 'cervical spinal manipulative therapy ( SMT )', 'chiropractic SMT and sham .', 'chiropractic SMT']",chiropractic SMT and sham,C,"['grip strength data', 'strength', 'grip strength comparison', 'differences in strength']",grip strength measured by a hydraulic dynamometer,C,,1.044724709212835,1.0,0.5,0.6666666666666666,69.23076923076923,1.010629663399238,1.0,0.2666666666666666,0.4210526315789474,30.0,0.1347796046234531,0.2857142857142857,0.2,0.2352941176470588,40.0
15960694,"Just-in-time evidence-based e-mail "" reminders "" in home health care: impact on nurse practices. OBJECTIVE To test the effectiveness of two interventions designed to improve the adoption of evidence-based practices by home health nurses caring for heart failure ( HF ) patients. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING Information on nurse practices was abstracted from the clinical records of patients admitted between June 2000 and November 2001 to the care of 354 study nurses at a large, urban, nonprofit home care agency. STUDY DESIGN The study employed a randomized design with nurses assigned to usual care or one of two intervention groups upon identification of an eligible patient. The basic intervention was a one-time e-mail reminder highlighting six HF-specific clinical recommendations. The augmented intervention consisted of the initial e-mail reminder supplemented by provider prompts, patient education material, and clinical nurse specialist outreach. DATA COLLECTION At each home health visit provided by a study nurse to an eligible HF patient during the 45-day follow-up period, a structured chart abstraction tool was used to collect information on whether the nurse provided the care practices highlighted in the e-mail reminder. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Both the basic and the augmented interventions greatly increased the practice of evidence-based care, according to patient records, in the areas of patient assessment and instructions about HF disease management. While not all results were statistically significant at conventional levels, intervention effects were positive in virtually all cases and effect magnitudes frequently were large. CONCLUSIONS The results of this randomized trial strongly support the efficacy of just-in-time evidence-based reminders as a means of changing clinical practice among home health nurses who are geographically dispersed and spend much of their time in the field.","['impact on nurse practices .', 'home health nurses caring for heart failure ( HF ) patients .', 'Information on nurse practices was abstracted from the clinical records of patients admitted between June 2000 and November 2001 to the care of 354 study nurses at a large , urban , nonprofit home care agency .', 'home health nurses']","home health nurses caring for heart failure (HF) patients at a large, urban, nonprofit home care agency",C,"['one-time e-mail reminder highlighting six HF-specific clinical recommendations .', 'initial e-mail reminder supplemented by provider prompts , patient education material , and clinical nurse specialist outreach .']","1.

19817753,"The effect of oral steroids with and without vitamin D3 on early efficacy of immunotherapy in asthmatic children. BACKGROUND The possibility of additional strategies to enhance the effectiveness of specific immunotherapy ( SIT ) is highly attractive. AIM The aim of our study was to assess the influence of oral corticosteroids and oral corticosteroids combined with vitamin D ( 3 ) on the early clinical and immunological effects of SIT. METHODS It was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 54 asthmatic children allergic to house dust mites. Intervention was based on receiving a single dose of oral steroid, with or without vitamin D ( 3 ), or placebo only on the day of the build-up phase of SIT. RESULTS After 12 months of SIT, the median daily inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) dose, which controls the symptoms of asthma, was reduced by 25 % in the steroid group. However, a 50 % reduction of the median daily ICS dose was observed in the control group. The clinical effects of SIT were not affected in the steroid+D ( 3 ) group. Concomitantly, we found that intervention with prednisone significantly impaired the induction of T regulatory lymphocytes. Importantly, the clinical and immunological effects of SIT were not affected by intervention with steroids administered with vitamin D ( 3 ). CONCLUSIONS Our study failed to show a beneficial effect of oral corticosteroids on allergen-specific immunotherapy. We observed that the combined administration of a corticosteroid drug and allergen extract suppressed the early clinical and immunological effects of SIT and that vitamin D ( 3 ) prevented this 'adverse ' influence of steroids.","['asthmatic children .', '54 asthmatic children allergic to house dust mites .', 'steroid group .', 'control group .', 'steroid+D ( 3 ) group .']",54 asthmatic children allergic to house dust mites,C,"['steroids with and without vitamin D3', 'corticosteroids', 'oral corticosteroids combined with vitamin D ( 3 )', 'single dose of oral steroid , with or without vitamin D ( 3 )', 'placebo', 'steroid', 'combined administration of a corticosteroid drug and allergen']","receiving a single dose of oral steroid, with or without vitamin D (3), or placebo only on the day of the build-up phase of SIT",C,"['median daily inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) dose', 'median daily ICS dose', 'induction of T regulatory lymphocytes .']","median daily inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) dose reduction, clinical and immunological effects of SIT, induction of T regulatory lymphocytes",C,,0.9855258535592429,1.0,0.4444444444444444,0.6153846153846153,50.0,0.5713202664140662,0.5,0.3714285714285714,0.4262295081967213,55.55555555555556,0.565095935747575,0.6111111111111112,0.7333333333333333,0.6666666666666666,100.0
21430242,"Fecal butyrate levels vary widely among individuals but are usually increased by a diet high in resistant starch. Butyrate and other SCFA produced by bacterial fermentation of resistant starch ( RS ) or nonstarch polysaccharides ( NSP ) promote human colonic health. To examine variation in fecal variables, especially butyrate, among individuals and the response to these fibers, a randomized cross-over study was conducted that compared the effects of foods supplying 25 g of NSP or 25 g of NSP plus 22 g of RS/d over 4 wk in 46 healthy adults ( 16 males, 30 females ; age 31-66 y ). Fecal SCFA levels varied widely among participants at entry ( butyrate concentrations: 3.5-32.6 mmol/kg ; butyrate excretions: 0.3-18.2 mmol/48 h ). BMI explained 27 % of inter-individual butyrate variation, whereas protein, starch, carbohydrate, fiber, and fat intake explained up to 16, 6, 2, 4, and 2 % of butyrate variation, respectively. Overall, acetate, butyrate, and total SCFA concentrations were higher when participants consumed RS compared with entry and NSP diets, but individual responses varied. Individual and total fecal SCFA excretion, weight, and moisture were higher than those for habitual diets when either fiber diet was consumed. SCFA concentrations ( except butyrate ) and excretions were higher for males than for females. Butyrate levels increased in response to RS in most individuals but often decreased when entry levels were high. Fecal butyrate and ammonia excretions were positively associated ( ( 2 ) = 0.76 ; P < 0.001 ). In conclusion, fecal butyrate levels vary widely among individuals but consuming a diet high in RS usually increases levels and may help maintain colorectal health.","['46 healthy adults ( 16 males , 30 females ; age 31-66 y ) .

12005275,"Rizatriptan 5 mg for the acute treatment of migraine in adolescents: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. OBJECTIVE To investigate the tolerability and efficacy of rizatriptan 5 mg in adolescent migraineurs. METHODS Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients aged 12 to 17 years received rizatriptan 5 mg ( n = 149 ) or placebo ( n = 147 ) for a moderate or severe headache and for up to two recurrences. Headache severity, presence or absence of associated symptoms, and functional disability were assessed over a 4-hour postdose period, and any adverse events were recorded. The primary efficacy measure was pain-free status at 2 hours postdose. RESULTS Rizatriptan 5 mg was well tolerated. The most commonly reported adverse events ( all with incidence of 5 % or less ) among patients receiving rizatriptan were dry mouth, dizziness, asthenia/fatigue, nausea, and somnolence. The percentage of patients pain-free at 2 hours was 32 % for rizatriptan 5 mg versus 28 % for placebo ( P=.474 ). The percentage of patients with pain relief ( reduction of predose pain intensity to mild or none ) at 2 hours was 66 % for rizatriptan versus 56 % for placebo ( P=.079 ). Placebo response rates were higher than those typically observed in previous studies of rizatriptan in adults. Compared with placebo, rizatriptan significantly improved functional disability at 1.5 and 2 hours, and nausea at 1 and 1.5 hours. Post hoc analysis showed a significant benefit of rizatriptan versus placebo in the percentage of patients who had pain relief when their migraine attacks were treated on weekends ( 65 % versus 36 %, P=.046 ) compared with weekdays ( 66 % versus 61 %, P=.365 ), and the weekend placebo response rate was similar to that seen in adults.

17845737,"Expectancies, not aroma, explain impact of lavender aromatherapy on psychophysiological indices of relaxation in young healthy women. OBJECTIVES In aromatherapy, lavender aroma is reputed to assist with relaxation. However, while there is much anecdotal evidence to that effect, the empirical literature is very inconsistent. Failure to employ adequate placebos, proper blinding, objective measures, or screening of prior beliefs about aromatherapy means that many previous findings could have been influenced by expectancy biases. The present study sought to establish whether lavender aroma and/or expectancies affect post-stress relaxation. DESIGN A double-blind, 3 ( aroma ) x 3 ( instruction ) x 10 ( time in minutes ) mixed-factorial placebo-controlled trial. METHOD In a laboratory, 96 healthy undergraduate women were exposed to lavender, placebo, or no aroma during physiologically assessed relaxation after an arousing cognitive task. Where an aroma was presented, an instructional priming procedure was used to manipulate participants ' expectancies about the aroma 's likely impact on their ability to relax. RESULTS Results showed no effect of aroma on galvanic skin response during relaxation. However, the nature of instructional prime was associated with relaxation patterns: when expecting the aroma to inhibit them, participants relaxed more ; when expecting facilitation, participants relaxed less. The effect was not seen with regard to self-reported relaxation ( as represented by changes in state anxiety ) and was independent of ratings of attitudes towards aromatherapy. CONCLUSIONS The findings imply that the previous associations of lavender aroma with assisted relaxation may have been influenced by expectancy biases, and that the relevant expectancies are easily manipulable.","['young healthy women .', '96 healthy undergraduate women']",96 healthy undergraduate women,C,"['lavender aromatherapy', 'aromatherapy , lavender aroma', 'placebos', 'lavender aroma', 'mixed-factorial placebo-controlled', 'exposed to lavender , placebo , or no aroma', 'cognitive task .', 'lavender aroma']","exposure to lavender, placebo, or no aroma during physiologically assessed relaxation after an arousing cognitive task; instructional priming procedure to manipulate participants' expectancies about the aroma's likely impact on their ability to relax",C,"['aroma on galvanic skin response', 'relaxation patterns :', 'relaxed', 'relaxed', 'self-reported relaxation', 'attitudes']","no effect of aroma on galvanic skin response during relaxation; instructional prime was associated with relaxation patterns (expecting aroma to inhibit led to more relaxation, expecting facilitation led to less relaxation); no effect on self-reported relaxation (changes in state anxiety); independent of ratings of attitudes towards aromatherapy",C,O_predictions contains outcomes AND results,1.010629663399238,1.0,0.5714285714285714,0.7272727272727273,80.0,0.2801104466637379,0.2647058823529412,0.391304347826087,0.3157894736842105,45.45454545454545,0.1550154332486361,0.2708333333333333,1.0,0.4262295081967213,81.81818181818183

25465111,"The durability of endovascular coiling versus neurosurgical clipping of ruptured cerebral aneurysms: 18 year follow-up of the UK cohort of the International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial ( ISAT ). BACKGROUND Previous analyses of the International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial ( ISAT ) cohort have reported on the risks of recurrent subarachnoid haemorrhage and death or dependency for a minimum of 5 years and up to a maximum of 14 years after treatment of a ruptured intracranial aneurysm with either neurosurgical clipping or endovascular coiling. At 1 year there was a 7 % absolute and a 24 % relative risk reduction of death and dependency in the coiling group compared with the clipping group, but the medium-term results showed the increased need for re-treatment of the target aneurysm in the patients given coiling. We report the long-term follow-up of patients in this UK cohort. METHODS In ISAT, patients were randomly allocated to either neurosurgical clipping or endovascular coiling after a subarachnoid haemorrhage, assuming treatment equipoise, between Sept 12, 1994, and May 1, 2002. We followed up 1644 patients in 22 UK neurosurgical centres for death and clinical outcomes for 10Â·0-18Â·5 years. We assessed dependency as self-reported modified Rankin scale score obtained through yearly questionnaires. Data for recurrent aneurysms and rebleeding events were collected from questionnaires and from hospital and general practitioner records. The Office for National Statistics supplied data on deaths. This study is registered, number ISRCTN49866681. FINDINGS At 10 years, 674 ( 83 % ) of 809 patients allocated endovascular coiling and 657 ( 79 % ) of 835 patients allocated neurosurgical clipping were alive ( odds ratio [ OR ] 1Â·35, 95 % CI 1Â·06-1Â·73 ). Of 1003 individuals who returned a questionnaire at 10 years, 435 ( 82 % ) patients treated with endovascular coiling and 370 ( 78 % ) patients treated with neurosurgical clipping were independent ( modified Rankin scale score 0-2 ; OR 1Â·25 ; 95 % CI 0Â·92-1Â·71 ). Patients in the endovascular treatment group were more likely to be alive and independent at 10 years than were patients in the neurosurgery group ( OR 1Â·34, 95 % CI 1Â·07-1Â·67 ). 33 patients had a recurrent subarachnoid haemorrhage more than 1 year after their initial haemorrhage ( 17 from the target aneurysm ). INTERPRETATION Although rates of increased dependency alone did not differ between groups, the probability of death or dependency was significantly greater in the neurosurgical group than in the endovascular group. Rebleeding was more likely after endovascular coiling than after neurosurgical clipping, but the risk was small and the probability of disability-free survival was significantly greater in the endovascular group than in the neurosurgical group at 10 years.

The bupivacaine group ( n=30 ) received 20cc of 0.5 % bupivacaine in at the same surgical site. Pain was assessed at 0, 6, 12, and 24 hours by using a visual analog scale ( VAS ). RESULTS A significant difference ( P=.018 ) was observed in pain levels between both groups at 6 hours postoperatively. The average analgesic requirement was lower in the bupivacaine group, but this did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS In our study, the use of bupivacaine irrigated over the surgical bed was an effective method for reducing pain during the first postoperative hours after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.","['Irrigation with bupivacaine at the surgical bed for postoperative pain relief after laparoscopic cholecystectomy .', 'laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients .', '60 patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy who were prospectively randomized into 2 groups .']",60 patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy,C,"['bupivacaine', 'bupivacaine', 'placebo', '20cc saline without bupivacaine', 'bupivacaine', '0.5 % bupivacaine', 'bupivacaine', 'bupivacaine']","The placebo group (n=30) received 20cc saline without bupivacaine, installed into the gallbladder bed.

15172423,"Comparative effects of valsartan versus amlodipine on left ventricular mass and reactive oxygen species formation by monocytes in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. OBJECTIVES To compare the effects of the angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB ) valsartan versus the calcium channel blocker amlodipine, reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) formation by monocytes, C-reactive protein ( CRP ), and left ventricular ( LV ) mass were studied in 104 hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH ). BACKGROUND There is evidence that ARBs have blood pressure ( BP ) -independent effects on LV mass. Whether regression of LV mass by ARBs is correlated to ROS formation by monocytes and CRP is not fully understood yet. METHODS A cross-sectional and prospective study was performed. Participants were randomly assigned to either the 80-mg valsartan ( n = 52 ) or 5-mg amlodipine ( n = 52 ) group and were treated for eight months. The left ventricular mass index ( LVMI ) was calculated from two-dimensional M-mode echocardiography. Formation of ROS by monocytes was measured by gated flow cytometry. In addition, CRP, plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone, and traditional risk factors were assessed. RESULTS Multiple regression analysis showed a significant correlation between LVMI and ROS formation by monocytes and between LVMI and CRP. Treatment reduced BP to a similar extent in both groups. Valsartan significantly reduced LVMI after eight months, but amlodipine had less effect ( 16 % vs. 1.2 %, n = 50, p < 0.01 ). Formation of ROS by monocytes was reduced to a greater extent with valsartan than with amlodipine ( 28 % vs. 2 %, n = 50, p < 0.01 ). Valsartan but not amlodipine reduced CRP levels. A significant correlation between changes in ROS formation by monocytes and LVMI or between CRP and LVMI was observed.

9070546,"Comparison of arbutamine and exercise echocardiography in diagnosing myocardial ischemia. Arbutamine is a new catecholamine designed for use as a pharmacologic stress agent. This study compared the sensitivity of arbutamine with symptom-limited exercise to induce echocardiographic signs of ischemia. Arbutamine was administered by a computerized closed-loop delivery system that controls the infusion rate of arbutamine toward a predefined rate of heart rate increase and maximum heart rate limit. Beta blockers were stopped > or = 48 hours before both tests. Stress was stopped for intolerable symptoms, or clinical, electrocardiographic or echocardiographic signs of ischemia ( new or worsening wall motion abnormality ), target heart rate ( > or = 85 % age predicted maximum heart rate ), or plateau of heart rate response. Thirty-seven patients were entered into the study ( 35 arbutamine and exercise, 1 arbutamine only, 1 exercise only ), of which 30 had angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease ( > or = 50 % lumen diameter narrowing ). Rate-pressure product increased significantly in response to both stress modalities ( p < 0.001 ) and was significantly greater with exercise ( 11,308 +/- 2,443 ) than with arbutamine ( 9,486 +/- 2,479, p < 0.001 ). The time to maximum heart rate was longer during arbutamine stress echocardiography than during exercise testing ( 17.3 +/- 9.4 versus 9.3 +/- 4.2 minutes, respectively, p < 0.001 ). There were more patients with interpretable echo data for arbutamine ( 82 % ) than for exercise ( 67 % ). Sensitivity for recognition of myocardial ischemia was 94 % ( 95 % confidence interval 70 % to 100 % ) and 88 % ( 95 % confidence interval 62 % to 98 % ), respectively. The most frequent adverse events during arbutamine ( n = 36 ) were dyspnea ( 5.6 % ) and tremor ( 5.6 % ). Two arbutamine stress tests were discontinued due to arrhythmias: 1 patient had premature atrial and ventricular beats, and the other had premature atrial contractions and atrial fibrillation. Arrhythmias were well tolerated and resolved without sequelae.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of epoetin zeta, compared with epoetin alfa, in maintaining target haemoglobin ( Hb ) concentrations in patients with anaemia and chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) maintained on haemodialysis. METHODS Patients received epoetin zeta or epoetin alfa intravenously, 1-3 times/week for 12 weeks, then the alternative treatment for 12 weeks, in this double-blind, crossover, phase III trial. Eligible patients were 18-75 years old with CKD stage 5 maintained on haemodialysis. Patients had received epoetin for > or = 3 months upon study entry and had achieved a target Hb level of 10.5-12.5 g/dL with a stable epoetin dose. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Primary efficacy endpoints were intra-individual differences ( test-reference ) in mean Hb levels and mean weekly dose/kg of body weight. Safety endpoints included occurrence of neutralizing anti-erythro poietin antibodies, tolerability, and adverse events ( AEs ). RESULTS In total, 313 patients were randomized to receive epoetin zeta ( n = 155 ) or epoetin alfa ( n = 158 ) ; 146 and 145 patients ( respectively ) switched treatment after 12 weeks. Mean ( range ) Hb levels were 11.35 ( 8.96-14.22 ) g/dL and 11.54 ( 8.74-13.84 ) g/dL for patients receiving epoetin zeta and epoetin alfa, respectively ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] [ test-reference ]: 0.09-0.28 g/dL, within the predefined equivalence range of +/-0.6 g/dL ). Mean ( range ) weekly doses were 92.68 ( 12.74-398.41 ) IU/kg/wk and 92.58 ( 10.53-393.07 ) IU/kg/wk for patients receiving epoetin zeta and epoetin alfa, respectively ( 95 % CI [ test-reference ]: -4.67 and 4.29 IU/kg/wk, within the equivalence range of +/-45.00 IU/kg/wk ). Patients underwent minor nominal dose adjustments during treatment crossover. AE profile was similar for both products ; the most commonly reported AEs were infections and infestations ( in 26.5 % of patients receiving epoetin zeta and 23.6 % receiving epoetin alfa ). No patients developed neutralizing anti-erythropoietin antibodies.

11319711,"Physiologic modeling of the intravenous glucose tolerance test in type 2 diabetes: a new approach to the insulin compartment. The minimal model of Bergman et al has been used to yield estimates of insulin sensitivity ( Si ) and glucose effectiveness ( Sg ) in type 2 diabetes by incorporating exogenous insulin protocols into the regular intravenous glucose tolerance test ( IVGTT ). These estimates, however, are influenced by the degree to which the dose of exogenous insulin is greater than the physiologic response to a glucose load. Moreover, most studies have related to type 2 diabetes subjects whose diabetes was relatively mild in terms of therapeutic requirements. To develop a "" minimal disturbance "" approach in estimating Si and Sg in type 2 diabetes, we have used a reduced glucose load ( 200 mg/kg ) and a "" physiologic "" insulin infusion throughout the IVGTT in a series of 8 patients, 5 of whom were insulin-requiring. Data from this approach were analyzed using the modelling program CONSAM to apply the Bergman model, either unmodified ( BMM ), or incorporating an additional delay element between the plasma and "" remote "" insulin compartments ( MMD ). Application of the MMD and extension of the IVGTT from 3 to 5 hours improved successful resolution of Si and Sg from 37.5 % ( BMM, 3-hour IVGTT ) to 100 % ( MMD, 5-hour IVGTT ). Si was reduced in these type 2 diabetes patients compared with normal subjects ( 1.86 +/- 0.60 v. 8.65 +/- 2.27 min ( -1 ) x microU ( -1 ) x mL x 10 ( 4 ) P <.01 ). The results were validated in the type 2 diabetes group using a 2-stage euglycemic clamp ( ( Si ) CLAMP = 2.02 +/- 0.42 min ( -1 ) x microU ( -1 ) x mL x 10 ( 4 ) P >.4 ). Sg was not significantly reduced ( 2.00 +/- 0.25 type 2 diabetes v. 1.55 +/- 0.26 normal min ( -1 ) x 10 ( 2 ) ). Data from a group of normal nondiabetic subjects was then analyzed using the MMD, but this approach did not enhance the fit of the model compared with the BMM. This result indicates that the delay in insulin action in type 2 diabetes represents an abnormality whereby the onset of insulin action can not be described as a single phase in the transfer of insulin from plasma to the remote compartment. It is postulated that the physiologic basis for this delayed action may relate to transcapillary endothelial transfer of insulin, this process limiting the rate of onset of insulin action.","['type 2 diabetes :', 'type 2 diabetes subjects', '8 patients , 5 of whom were insulin-requiring .', 'type 2 diabetes group', 'normal nondiabetic subjects']","8 patients with type 2 diabetes, 5 of whom were insulin-requiring",C,"['exogenous insulin protocols', 'exogenous insulin', 'reduced glucose load', 'and a "" physiologic "" insulin infusion']",reduced glucose load (200 mg/kg) and a 'physiologic' insulin infusion throughout the IVGTT,C,"['intravenous glucose tolerance test', 'insulin sensitivity ( Si ) and glucose effectiveness ( Sg )', 'Si and Sg', 'resolution of Si and Sg', 'Si', 'Sg']",Si (insulin sensitivity) was reduced in type 2 diabetes patients compared with normal subjects; Sg (glucose effectiveness) was not significantly reduced,P,,0.6656394448290993,0.75,0.4090909090909091,0.5294117647058824,61.53846153846154,0.2016003129794653,0.5714285714285714,0.6153846153846154,0.5925925925925927,66.66666666666666,0.1299973355251235,0.1904761904761904,0.1904761904761904,0.1904761904761904,66.66666666666666

The aim of this study was to compare adverse mood effects of two different doses of medroxyprogesterone acetate ( MPA ) during postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) in women with and without a history of premenstrual syndrome ( PMS ). The study was designed as a randomized double-blind cross-over study and included 36 postmenopausal women at three health care areas in northern Sweden. The women received 2 mg estradiol continuously during five 28-day cycles and 10 mg or 20 mg MPA sequentially for 12 days during each cycle. The main outcome measures were mood and physical symptoms noted on a daily rating scale. We found that physical symptoms did not differ between 10 and 20 mg MPA. Both women with a history of PMS and women without responded with more negative mood symptoms with the lower dose of MPA. In women with previous PMS the higher dose of MPA enhanced positive mood symptoms.

OBJECTIVE To validate an FFQ for the assessment of dietary EPA and DHA against their relative concentrations in red blood cells ( RBC ). DESIGN Cross-sectional analysis of baseline data. Intakes of marine food products and EPA and DHA were estimated by FFQ on the basis of consumption of marine food products in the last month. Fatty acid composition of RBC membranes was quantified by GC. SETTING Saint-FranÃ§ois d'Assise Hospital, QuÃ©bec, Canada. SUBJECTS A total of sixty-five middle-aged women who participated in a randomized clinical trial. RESULTS Spearman 's correlation coefficient between intake of EPA, DHA and EPA + DHA and their corresponding concentration in RBC was 0.46, 0.40 and 0.42, respectively ( all P < 0.05 ). Multiple regression analysis of EPA+DHA intake and RBC EPA + DHA concentration indicated positive and significant correlations for oily fish ( beta = 0.44, 95 % CI 0.16, 0.72, P = 0.0027 ), total fish ( beta = 0.42, 95 % CI 0.19, 0.64, P = 0.0005 ) and marine food products ( beta = 0.42, 95 % CI 0.20, 0.64, P = 0.0003 ). No other marine food products significantly predicted RBC EPA + DHA concentration. CONCLUSIONS Although the present validation study was undertaken among middle-aged women with low consumption of marine food products ( < 3 servings/week ), our FFQ provided estimates of EPA and DHA intakes that correlated fairly well with their RBC concentrations. However, the absence of correlations between EPA + DHA intakes from different marine species suggests that a minimum EPA + DHA intake is necessary to observe a relationship with RBC EPA + DHA concentrations.","[""Saint-FranÃƒÂ§ois d'Assise Hospital , QuÃƒÂ©bec , Canada"", 'of sixty-five middle-aged women who participated in a randomized clinical trial', 'among middle-aged women with low consumption of marine food products ( < 3 servings/week )']",A total of sixty-five middle-aged women who participated in a randomized clinical trial,P,"['EPA', 'DHA', 'marine food products', 'EPA', 'DHA', 'marine food products', 'of EPA , DHA and EPA + DHA', 'and marine food products', 'predicted RBC EPA + DHA', 'minimum EPA + DHA', 'RBC EPA + DHA']",Intakes of marine food products and EPA and DHA were estimated by FFQ on the basis of consumption of marine food products in the last month,C,"['EPA and DHA intake .', 'EPA and DHA', 'relative concentrations in red blood cells ( RBC ) .', 'between intake of EPA , DHA and EPA + DHA', 'corresponding concentration in RBC', 'of EPA+DHA intake and RBC EPA + DHA concentration', 'predicted RBC EPA + DHA concentration', 'of EPA and DHA intakes', 'their RBC concentrations', 'between EPA + DHA intakes', 'with RBC EPA + DHA concentrations']","Spearman 's correlation coefficient between intake of EPA, DHA and EPA + DHA and their corresponding concentration in RBC was 0.46, 0.40 and 0.42, respectively ( all P < 0.05 ); Multiple regression analysis of EPA+DHA intake and RBC EPA + DHA concentration indicated positive and significant correlations for oily fish ( beta = 0.44, 95 % CI 0.16, 0.72, P = 0.0027 ), total fish ( beta = 0.42, 95 % CI 0.19, 0.64, P = 0.0005 ) and marine food products ( beta = 0.42, 95 % CI 0.20, 0.64, P = 0.0003 )",C,O_predictions contains outcomes AND results,0.9355022465347015,0.8666666666666667,0.3611111111111111,0.5098039215686274,30.0,0.1397879704183117,0.3461538461538461,0.3,0.3214285714285714,55.55555555555556,0.2419518604329364,0.2365591397849462,0.3859649122807017,0.2933333333333333,58.82352941176471
1905592,"Effect of diltiazem on symptomatic and asymptomatic episodes of ST segment depression occurring during daily life and during exercise. BACKGROUND Silent myocardial ischemia is an adverse prognostic marker in patients with coronary disease ; however, controlled data on the effect of treatment are sparse and contradictory, and the relations among the occurrence of ST segment depression, drug efficacy, and heart rate are unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS Sixty patients with stable coronary artery disease, a positive treadmill exercise test and asymptomatic ST segment depression on ambulatory electrocardiographic recording were assessed in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial. Treadmill exercise tests and 72-hour electrocardiographic recordings were obtained at the end of two 2-week treatment periods with sustained-release diltiazem 180 mg b.i.d. or equivalent placebo. Episodes of asymptomatic ST depression decreased by 50 % or more in 70 % of the patients from a median number of 4.5 ( range, 0-19 ) to 1.5 ( range, 0-13 ) ( p = 0.0001 ) ; their cumulative duration also decreased from 78.5 ( range, 0-60 ) to 24.5 ( range, 0-411 ) minutes ( p = 0.001 ). No circadian variation was found in the efficacy of diltiazem. The occurrence of ischemic type ST segment depression was modulated by changes in heart rate rather than by absolute heart rate. Diltiazem also improved exercise test end points but to a lesser extent. Time to ST segment depression increased to 341 +/- 148 from 296 +/- 154 seconds ( p = 0.005 ). Although less frequent with diltiazem administration ( 45 versus 54 patients, p less than 0.03 ), exercise-induced ST depression was more often asymptomatic ( 98 % versus 72 % of patients, p less than 0.0001 ). CONCLUSIONS Diltiazem reduces the frequency and severity of ischemic type ST depression in patients with stable coronary artery disease.","['symptomatic and asymptomatic episodes of ST segment depression occurring during daily life and during exercise .', 'patients with coronary disease ;', 'Sixty patients with stable coronary artery disease , a positive treadmill exercise test and asymptomatic ST segment depression on ambulatory electrocardiographic recording were assessed in a multicenter , double-blind , placebo-controlled , cross-over trial .', 'patients with stable coronary artery disease .']","Sixty patients with stable coronary artery disease, a positive treadmill exercise test and asymptomatic ST segment depression on ambulatory electrocardiographic recording",C,"['diltiazem', 'placebo-controlled', 'Treadmill exercise', 'sustained-release diltiazem', 'placebo .', 'diltiazem .', 'Diltiazem', 'diltiazem', 'Diltiazem']",sustained-release diltiazem 180 mg b.i.d. or equivalent placebo,C,"['ST segment depression', 'ST segment depression', 'Treadmill exercise tests', '72-hour electrocardiographic recordings', 'Episodes of asymptomatic ST depression', 'cumulative duration', 'circadian variation', 'ischemic type ST segment depression', 'changes in heart rate', 'exercise test end points', 'Time to ST segment depression', 'exercise-induced ST depression', 'ischemic type ST depression']",Episodes of asymptomatic ST depression decreased by 50 % or more in 70 % of the patients; cumulative duration of asymptomatic ST depression decreased; diltiazem improved exercise test end points; time to ST segment depression increased; exercise-induced ST depression was less frequent and more often asymptomatic with diltiazem administration,P,,1.1167470964180197,1.0,0.3620689655172414,0.5316455696202532,54.83870967741935,0.146842815373042,0.3636363636363636,0.3076923076923077,0.3333333333333333,57.14285714285714,0.2445700496786362,0.4583333333333333,0.4583333333333333,0.4583333333333333,50.0
15538933,"Blockade of endogenous growth hormone-releasing hormone receptors dissociates nocturnal growth hormone secretion and slow-wave sleep. OBJECTIVES A temporal association between non-rapid eye movement ( NREM ) sleep stages 3 and 4 and nocturnal augmentation of GH release was found long ago, yet the precise mechanism for this association has not been identified. It has been shown, however that pulsatile GHRH administration increases both slow-wave sleep ( SWS ) and GH. Based on these data, a role for GHRH as an inducer of SWS was proposed. To test this hypothesis, we have performed the corollary experiment whereby the action of endogenous GHRH has been antagonized. DESIGN Healthy men ( 20-33 years old ) had an infusion of GHRH antagonist ( ( N-Ac-Tyr ( 1 ), D-Arg ( 2 ) ) GHRH-29 ( NH ( 2 ) ) ) or saline for a 12-h period, between 2100 and 0900 h. An i.v. bolus of GHRH was given at 0700 h and GH samples were drawn from 0700 to 0900 h to document the efficacy of GH suppression by the GHRH antagonist. METHODS A limited montage sleep study was recorded from 2300 to 0700 h during each admission. Plasma GH concentrations were analyzed by the use of a sensitive chemiluminometric assay. RESULTS Effectiveness of the GHRH antagonist was validated in all subjects by demonstrating 93+/-1.8 % ( P=0.012 ) suppression of GH response to a GHRH bolus. Polysomnography demonstrated that the percentage of SWS was not different when saline and GHRH antagonist nights were compared ( P=0.607 ) ; other quantifiable sleep parameters were also unchanged. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that endogenous GHRH is indispensable for the nocturnal augmentation of GH secretion, but that it is unlikely to participate in the genesis of SWS.",['Healthy men ( 20-33 years old )'],Healthy men (20-33 years old),C,"['infusion of GHRH antagonist ( ( N-Ac-Tyr ( 1 ) , D-Arg ( 2 ) ) GHRH-29 ( NH ( 2 ) ) ) or saline for a 12-h period', 'GHRH']","Infusion of GHRH antagonist ((N-Ac-Tyr(1), D-Arg(2)) GHRH-29(NH(2))) or saline for a 12-h period, between 2100 and 0900 h.
